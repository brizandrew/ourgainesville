She went and stood in the garage.</p><p>	“No, come in the house,” Thomas said.</p><p>	The woman again said nothing. She went and stood on the porch.</p><p>	“No, come in my house,” Thomas said.</p><p>	The young woman relented and followed her inside. They sat at the dining room table and started to talk. </p><p>Thomas was also pregnant. They talked about pregnancy, family and the community.</p><p>Fifty-four years later, Thomas and Melissa Gould are still friends.</p><p>	“We were just like sisters,” Gould says. “Sometimes I think if she hadn’t been there I wouldn’t be here.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Picture-of-two-of-Thomas-children.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Carol Thomas' sons, Michael (left) and David, demonstrating on a Louisville sidewalk.

Gould was a pregnant woman who needed to walk home alone in a storm. Thomas realized not everyone had a car or someone to help them when they needed it.</p><p>	“If I need something, she comes,” Gould says.</p><p>	Gould’s aunt, Lucille, thanked Thomas for helping her niece by taking her around the Porters community and introducing her to the people living there.</p><blockquote class="right"><p>"We were just like sisters.

</p></blockquote><p>	“[Lucille] would take me into their homes and say, 'this is Carol, and she’s going to help us,'" Thomas says. "I was going to help them? What could I do?”</p><p>	 Thomas would help them register to vote and teach them about who was running in local elections. At first, she tried to convince black families to send their children to white schools.</p><p>	“There was a grandmother that I talked to, and I was telling her with great glee about how the children could go to a white school,” Thomas says. “She looked at me and said, ‘What’s so great about going to a white school?’”</p><p>	After that conversation, Thomas changed her mind about the issue.</p><p>	Since before that day in 1963 until now, when she's 83, Thomas has worked to protect human rights. On a journey that spans eight states, one thing has remained the same: she fights for those who may not be able to fight themselves.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>	Thomas was raised in Detroit during unrest of the early 1930s. Some of the things that later inspired her to help people happened right outside of her family’s home.</p><p>	“I remember seeing a man running away from… something,” Thomas says. “There was a police officer nearby and he ran up to him and shouted, ‘Help! They’re coming to get me!’ The police officer just turned to him and said, ‘You better run, boy.’”</p><figure class="img right"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/A-dress-belonging-to-Carol-from-her-childhood.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="A childhood dress belonging to Carol Thomas that her son had framed and gave to her as a gift.

One day, a pro-McCarthy group came to campus looking for suspected communists.</p><p>	She joined a crowd of students protesting the group’s arrival.</p><p>	“I guess that was what started me in activism,” Thomas says.</p><p>	She married Billy Thomas, a physicist, in 1953 and followed him as he moved from job to job.</p><p>	They settled in Gainesville in 1962.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Thomas' activism, in part, landed her in the Alachua County Jail for contempt of court.</p><p>	In 1966, a woman who had heard of Thomas through the Porters community visited her home. The woman told Thomas the guards at the Alachua County jail traded better treatment for sexual favors.</p><p>	After hearing the woman’s story, Thomas went to the Gainesville Police Department. The police sent her to Internal Affairs and told her they would get to the bottom of it. </p><p>Weeks went by with no word from the police. She went again.</p><p>	This time, the police told her they would set up a hearing with the City Commission. In turn, the Commission had Thomas<a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/415/550/279980/"> testify before a grand jury</a>.</p><p>	Thomas attended the grand jury hearing with Irven Lee Dawkins, a journalist and civil rights activist, and they co-wrote a leaflet about the issue called “Black Voices.”</p><figure class="img full"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Beginning-of-the-Black-Voices-newsletter.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="A copy of the &quot;Black Voices&quot; leaflet that Carol Thomas distributed before her grand jury testimony.

The court considered what she and Dawkins wrote in “Black Voices” to be a “veiled threat.” Thomas and Dawkins also distributed the leaflets outside of the jury room, which was seen by the court as an attempt to influence the jury.</p><p>	Word spread about Thomas’ arrest. Connie Canney, another Gainesville activist, went to the police to try and bail her out.</p><p>	“I went into the police station to try and bail her out, and I saw they had (Thomas’) house circled in red on a map,” she says. “You would think she was some hardened criminal.”</p><p>	Thomas’ three children stayed with her friends while she was in jail.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330969998&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Carol Thomas reflects on the time she spent in the Alachua County Jail.</figcaption></figure><p>	During her time in jail, Thomas and the other inmates became close. One day, she said the guards brought in a woman who was pregnant.</p><p>	Thomas believed the new inmate was having a miscarriage when the guards left her in a cell.</p><p>	She and the other inmates filled the toilets in their cells with anything they could get their hands on and flushed. They kept flushing until the water was spilling out, flooding the floor of their cells.</p><p>	The guards came and took the woman to the hospital.</p><p>	“If someone’s life was in danger, and they wouldn’t listen to us, we had to do something,” Thomas says. “There would be people they would bring into the jail that they found on the side of the road. This is not the place they should’ve brought them.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>	When Thomas was released in 1967, she says she had been told the state wanted to take her children away. She was afraid the state would “keep picking on her."</p><p>	Thomas divorced her husband in 1967 and moved to Louisville, Kentucky. She took a job working as an organizer with the Southern Conference Education Fund, a community action organization.</p><p>	While working there, Thomas was visited by a couple who said their landlord was trying to evict them because of a gas leak in the house. They said they called an inspector when they smelled gas and he had reported it to the landlord.</p><p>	“The way it worked was that the tenants had all the responsibility and the landlords had all the money,” Thomas says.</p><p>	She looked into the state of public housing in Louisville.</p><p>	“There would be houses that didn’t have any front doors,” Thomas says. “In fact, one child in one home was electrocuted. She was playing over by the television, which had exposed wiring on the back, and because the roof leaked the water had pooled near it. She touched it and was electrocuted.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Photo-of-Carol-with-a-homemade-picket-sign-5.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Carol Thomas holds a picket sign she used when demonstrating on Gainesville sidewalks.
