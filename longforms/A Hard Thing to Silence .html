A smile spreads across Vivian Filer’s face, the next few words rest on her lips, but she holds them back, like a secret.</p><p>“I love.”</p><p>She’s reciting a poem published rather recently for her taste, but she finds it lovely just the same. “Honey, I Love” by Eloise Greenfield.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/334591385&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Vivian Filer recites "I Love"</figcaption></figure><p>As she borrows Greenfield’s words, her voice softens, the words slide into one another. Filer puts the young southern subject of the poem right in front of her listeners.</p><p>Her voice bounces as she recites all the things this young girl loves. It plays between the sweet sounds of carefree youth and the aged wisdom of a seasoned storyteller.</p><p>Suddenly, it catches and the smile falls from her lips.</p><p>"It’s not so late at night, but I’m still in my bed,” Filer says, her voice quivering through a pout. “Honey, let me tell you, I don’t love to go to sleep."</p><p>Just then her voice brightens and she laughs as she recites the last stanza.</p><p>“But I love. I love a lot of things, and honey, I love you too.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Vivian Filer has always had a big voice. In the early 1950s, her church didn’t have microphones, but her voice filled the chapel. When WRUF radio allowed Lincoln High students to broadcast for 15 minutes to celebrate Black History Week, her teachers picked Filer to go on air.</p><p>With strong encouragement from church leaders and teachers, she learned to love her big voice — and to use it.</p><p>She was never taught to simply recite text, but to really read it, perform it, let the words sing.</p><p>The only trouble with a voice like that is it’s a hard thing to silence. And Filer, as a black woman living in the South, was expected to be quiet.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Vivian-Filer001-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Vivian Filer leaning against her storytelling tree across from the Gainesville Cotton Club.

By 14, she took her first job as a maid in another family’s home.</p><p>“It was the only thing offered to black people,” Filer says. “We weren’t going to be clerks in a store.”</p><p>After school, she would walk to the white family’s house to do their dishes, make their dinner and put their kids to bed before finally going home around 9 p.m. She would arrive home, do her chores, and then, finally, start her homework.</p><p>Late at night, after all her work was done, she would steal a few moments before bed to read. Many high school students might see the words of long-dead poets draped across a page in a drab, black-and-white monotone as just another academic obstacle to overcome. Filer was taught to speak those words, to go beyond written text and hear the human sounds, the crescendos and decrescendos, the addictive rhythm of poetry.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivian-Filer-0005.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Family portrait of Vivian Filer (center top) with her parents and three sisters.

Filer attended a segregated high school, which came with some disadvantages. Lincoln High almost always had second-hand books, falling apart after years of use in white schools. The buildings were mostly without air conditioning, so teachers and students opened windows and used fans to stave off the heavy Florida heat. But one distinct advantage of her situation was exposure to black culture and, especially, black literature.</p><p>The day she spoke on the radio, Filer recited “The Creation” by James Weldon Johnson; the story of Genesis spoken, rather than written.</p><p>“This Great God,” the poem reads, “Like a mammy bending over her baby / Kneeled down in the dust / Toiling over a lump of clay / Till He shaped it in His own image.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227911064"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After Filer’s high school graduation in 1956, she couldn’t move onto college. The University of Florida didn’t accept black students at the time, and Filer couldn’t afford to live away from home to attend a historically black college. Instead, she began working as a nursing assistant.</p><p>Filer would not be able to attend college for more than 10 years, until Santa Fe College opened as an integrated school in 1966.</p><p>Nursing evoked in her many of the same feelings that sparked her passion for poetry. Poems took work to understand and perform, but each one gave her insight into her world. As a nurse, her patients demanded her time and taxed her emotions, but in treating them, she found those same unique insights. She quickly grew to love the work.</p><p>Filer quickly found an important difference between her two passions. Nursing lacked the deep respect for African-American culture Filer cherished. She faced racism often — patients didn’t respect her and sometimes dismissed her entirely in favor of a white nurse.</p><p>And the doctors were no better, she says.</p><p>"If we were there,” she says of herself and her black co-workers, “and there was a white person in view, [a doctor] would go to the white person."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>As the 1950s came to a close, the cultural swell of the Civil Rights Movement poured into Gainesville. Filer heard about the work happening around the country by leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who inspired her to make change happen in her own community.</p><p>She was not the only person in Gainesville fed up with the status quo. A group of white women, mostly wives of University of Florida professors, also pressed for change. These women, barred from teaching at the university because of their gender, founded a group called Gainesville Women for Equal Rights, or GWER.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivan-Filer-0009.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Vivian Filer holds a photo of her family at her college graduation.

Here, again, she found her voice. She sang black spirituals as she marched, showing the protesters who filled the streets exactly why they were fighting.</p><p>But she was not just an activist — she was also a mom.</p><p>A mom who worked nights, so she would have time during the day to be with her kids. It was this work, the tireless, thankless work, in-between birthday parties and kids’ football games, that made progress possible.</p><p>"I’m often a minor player in whatever has to be done,” she says. “I just want to be in there doing something.</p><p>She was almost always doing some project or another outside of her work — and those projects weren’t always minor.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Filer and four other members of GWER began desegregating Gainesville’s healthcare system. They walked into segregated dentist offices and hospitals, and asked for equal treatment.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328465309&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Despite initial discomfort from the white doctors, the black community gained access to quality healthcare.</p><p>This was an impressive victory for civil rights, but it did not seem so extraordinary to Filer’s two young sons.</p><p>"I remember having a good experience with the dentist and being treated nicely,” says Craig Filer, the younger of the two. “The whole social significance totally escaped me."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Filer is 79 now. She’s retired, but that doesn’t mean she’s not working. She was instrumental in creating Depot Park as a popular neighborhood gathering place. When it became clear the land was unfit for most other purposes, Filer saw an opportunity to create a park for all residents of Gainesville, from the east and west side.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Vivan-Filer-0006-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Filer stands by the park sigh of Springhill Park in east Gainesville, a park she helped create.

Pegeen Hanrahan, mayor of Gainesville during the planning of Depot Park, deeply valued Filer’s perspective during the project.</p><p>“She brings with her a rich experience of growing up in east Gainesville,” says Hanrahan. “I really got to see her in action a great deal and just got to know her passion and skills.”</p><p>Currently, she is spearheading a project to restore the Gainesville Cotton Club. Her church, African Methodist Episcopal, bought the historic building from a furniture company, which had used it as a warehouse.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/335802147&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Vivian Filer recites Langston Hughes' famous poem "A Negro Speaks of Rivers" (Cover photo courtesy of Chris M.

She sings poems like “Little Brown Baby” by Paul Laurence Dunbar and “A Negro Speaks of Rivers” by Langston Hughes to children in her church.</p><p>The kids love her voice — she sometimes sings for them when playing musical chairs. She calls them her babies and tells them she loves them.&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian Filer loves a lot of things.</p><p>Honey, she loves. &nbsp;</p>
