Blood-red carnations, yellow daisies and rose buds in various purples, pinks and blues. A flower for every occasion.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	Melina leans in to study herself in her vanity mirror while she fastens a barrette of violet lilies into her hair. The lilies are the perfect shade, as they match the purple, floral knee-length dress that she is currently wearing. This fashion statement isn’t a mere coincidence. Every dress in Melina’s closet has a twin, a flower that goes just right.</p><blockquote class="right"><p>“These flowers have become a part of my identity,” Melina says. “It’s gotten to the point to where, if I don’t have them on, people notice.”



</p></blockquote><p>For anyone else, a flower clip is merely an accessory, a stemless plastic flower, but for Melina it’s so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>For her, as a transgender woman, it’s about living in the world as her true, genuine self.</p><p>When Melina first became aware that an abundance of flowers grew wild near her Newberry home, she saw an opportunity that she couldn’t resist. She had to put them to use.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MVI_0507-10.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina greets one of her friends, Blake Pfirrmann, before joining the crowd to march at Gainesville's Equality March for Unity and Pride on June 11.

Melina realized timing was not on her side, a feeling she’s constantly battled throughout her life. </p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Melina has been through the coming out process twice. The first time, in 2007, in California, she struggled to find a safe way to transition. She lacked support, information and resources.</p><p>Feeling defeated, Melina had just about given up on the idea of living in the world authentically, but she persisted.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331769625&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In March of 2016, Melina came out a second time. While many friends and family were quick to accept Melina, others took longer to accept her identity. As time went on, her family and friends gradually came around. A vase of flowers sits in the center of Melina’s living room table, flowers her parents sent her for Mother’s Day.</p><p>At 39, she’s lived her life as Melina for only one year. She has a lot of time to make up.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 5 years old, she would play dress-up with her older sister. She would try on her sister’s clothes, feel the fabric against her skin and feel alive. Even at that young age, she knew she was different, but she lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	“This feeling of wanting to be more feminine and female persisted in more subtle ways after that,” Melina says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I can remember in second grade, in particular, really wishing I could just be like the other girls.

Her boy clothes were like a suit of armor, another layer hiding who she really was from the world. Once again, she buried those feelings and lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>During her freshman year in high school, there was a day called 'Switch Day,' when everyone came to school dressed as the opposite gender.</p><p>“Even though I loved the idea, I was way too scared to do it myself,” Melina says. “Probably because I knew how much it meant to me subconsciously.”</p><p>She kept lying to herself.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Melinabefore191.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina shares a picture of herself wearing a Viking costume 20 years ago, when she was a part of the Sons of Norway, which is a fraternal organization celebrating those of Norwegian heritage.

(Courtesy of Melina Barratt)</figcaption></figure><p>The next year, one of Melina’s male friends got in trouble for wearing a kilt to school. A group of her male friends came up to her after school, and asked if she would join them in wearing a skirt in protest. Not realizing what the protest was for, she said yes.</p><p>She returned to school the next day in not only a skirt, but a bra filled with water balloons for breasts, pantyhose and heels. She woke up early before school to meet up with a friend who did her make-up. For Melina, wearing a skirt was just not enough.</p><p>Her last period of the day was P.E., and as she stood in the gymnasium contemplating which changing room she wanted to get undressed in before returning home, a girl Melina had a crush on, approached her.</p><p>Intrigued by Melina wearing female clothing, the girl asked her whether Melina would go through the whole female experience, specifically menstruation and pregnancy.</p><p>	“I very definitely remember answering, ‘Yes, yes I would,’” Melina says. “That was probably the closest I came to admitting I was transgender at the time.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"> Melina’s bedroom is a colorful utopia of femininity, from her walk-in closet packed with dresses, each touched with a certain memory from her transition, to her vanity, where brushes, eyeshadow and lipstick of various shades of red gather.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>“This dress doesn’t fit me unfortunately,” Melina says as she pulled out an olive green dress from the depths of her closet. “I’m a little too thick in the chest.”</p><p>Melina rolls her eyes and lets out a loud, infectious laugh.</p><p>She routinely uses self-deprecating humor to make light of the changes her body is making during her transition. While she’s physically changing, she’ll always be Melina. Her surgery, her transition, does not define who she is.<br></p><blockquote class="center"><p>There’s always such a focus on the surgery,” Melina rolls her eyes again. “You don’t ask anyone when their last mammogram or their last prostate exam was, you know? Why would you ask a Trans person about the surgery? It’s really personal.




</p></blockquote><p>For Melina, living as herself means for her to be seen, to be heard and to be able to move through society without question. It’s about being truthful to herself and to her body.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MelinaBarratt482.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina alongside her fiancé, El, and her two stepchildren, Ari and Naomi.

The binders are sparkly pink, but come in an assortment of colors including various shades of skin tone.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/IMG_0524.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina and El share an intimate moment during Gainesville's Equality March for Unity and Pride on June 11.

The tightness of the binding can have negative side effects, from back pain to postural issues, but for El, it’s worth it. That small amount of fabric is enough to make El feel comfortable in their skin, a feeling Melina can empathize with.</p><p><pclass="msonormal">Melina looks down at her living room carpet and frowns. Dog
hair. She has a friend coming to visit the next week, and was hoping to have
the place clean.



</pclass="msonormal"></p><p>“I haven’t officially invited her yet,” El admits from the
couch.</p><p>“Get to it, woman not woman,” Melina smirks, her body
shaking as she audibly holds back a fit of laughter.</p><p>El sarcastically groans and Melina cackles. She got the
reaction she was looking for.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226806922"></iframe><figcaption>Melina shares her experience as a transgender woman living in North Central Florida.

them, it’s a way of coping. They’re both fighting to be seen, to be understood
