He wondered, was this the end of his journey?</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Mercer9.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Bryan Mercer, 57, joined the Hippodrome Theatre as actor and musical director in Apirl 2017.

He is a composer. He is a stage director and designer, and, most importantly, he is a teacher. Mercer joined the Hippodrome Theatre in the spring, in the heart of downtown Gainesville.</p><p>Mercer turned his life around, learning from his past mistakes. He is a role model to anyone who has hit rock bottom.</p><p>"I’m so blessed to have such a fascinating and fun life,” Mercer says. “I may only be 57, but in this short time I’ve been here, I have lived, loved and suffered more than most. I feel sorry for those that don’t. I feel like I’m getting a complete experience of life. I’m still learning, I’m still working on things, I’m still scared and I’m still excited about living."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Mercer travels the country hosting workshops. He teaches people of all ages how to get the negative voices out of their head and focus more on their body and their emotions.</p><p>He starts his self-help workshops by having each person walk up to a mirror, examine themselves and say “I love you.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Mercer21.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Mercer studies his Jazz Music Collection book in the Hippodrome Theatre.

Mercer ended up getting the part — instead of his friend —&nbsp;and has been acting ever since.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Although he was attracted to the limelight, Mercer's childhood was not always glamorous.</p><p>He comes from an abusive household and knew the Alcoholics Anonymous family well. Mercer’s father, Rodney Mercer, was an alcoholic. His mother, Sylvia Mercer, was an "enabler." Holidays weren't always cheerful, but instead were a time filled with drinking, violence and frequent beatings, Mercer says.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330955103&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Mercer's grandparents, Robert and Doris Yonge, provided the stability for him and his siblings. They always had food on the table and taught their grandchildren manners and unconditional acceptance. Mercer spent a majority of his youth with his grandparents and their friends because that is where he felt most comfortable.</p><p>"We grew up in severe isolation, it was just the three of us,” his sister Vicki Mercer says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If it wasn’t for our grandparents, there’s no telling how the three of us would have turned out.







</p></blockquote><p>When Mercer was 11 years old, he visited maximum-security prisons with his parents and his siblings to give speeches and tell prisoners about opportunities through AA.</p><p>Often, when standing in front of the microphone, he felt unworthy, unprepared and alone. He spoke to a sea of scowling faces about the impact AA had on his life.</p><p>But it wasn't enough.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>At age 16, &nbsp;he played the piano in the front bay window of Peter Dinkles, a bar built in the 1890s in Ocala. As he played, older men tipped him with drinks. He started to enjoy the bourbon and Manhattans.&nbsp;</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Mercer20.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Mercer plays the piano at The Hippodrome Theatre.

Mercer moved there for the opportunity to work in film, its open gay community and the disco clubs.</p><p>Three years later, Mercer moved to New York City for a fresh start, but soon he found himself on the streets after his boyfriend kicked him out without warning.</p><p>He spent several days sleeping on park benches in Brooklyn, cold and alone, before moving back to Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends and family threw Mercer a birthday party in Atlanta in February 1987. As hard as Mercer tried, he could not remember the cake, balloons, the people or the amount of drinks he had at the party. He felt humiliated, and realized his drinking had gotten out of hand. He needed to make a decision.</p><p>“While sitting on a park bench in Atlanta, I knew I had to choose. I had the option to keep drinking and die, or to sober up and live,” Mercer says.</p><p>Mercer decided to “flip the switch” and stop drinking — cold turkey. He has been sober ever since.</p><p>"I won’t call it a weakness, because that weakness made me who I am, and gave me the strength and the toolbox that very few others have," he says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Once you’ve wrestled enough demons, you realize you’re a good demon wrestler.









</p></blockquote><p>Mercer attributes his mistakes to what makes him such a great actor today. He never took an acting class, but learned how to act and teach through his own life experiences.</p><p>While a young actor in the '80s, Mercer operated as professional escort and sex worker in Atlanta.</p><p>“In that business you have to learn what they want,” Mercer says. “You become that, quickly, and survive it.”</p><p>He was the “star boy” and ran the office. He hired, fired and trained all of “the boys.” Mercer was sent on jobs that were a “suspected bust,” set up by police because he had the best instincts to assess the situation. He knew how to conduct himself in an expensive restaurant, formal function or any other delicate situations.</p><figure class="full video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225129577"></iframe><figcaption>Mercer speaks about his experience with The Hippodrome Theatre. (Sydney Brodie / WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>But it all came to an end on Father’s Day in 1987 when he took a call to a "less than glamorous" hotel in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>He was greeted by a handsome young man who was polite and talkative. While waiting for the man to make the first move — the escort is not allowed to make the first physical or verbal move — Mercer slipped up and uttered an "innocuous euphuism."</p><p>The adjoining room door swung open and he was cuffed in a matter of seconds.</p><p>“This is my scarlet letter that will never go away,” Mercer says. “I live in its shadow in full honesty, humility and hope for others.”</p><p>Mercer's sex-worker career ended that day in a dark and dingy hotel room, but he carries the lessons with him on stage and into the classroom.</p><p>“Life is too short and miserable to exist without a dream. I'm here. Right here, right now. Might as well make the best of it,” Mercer says.</p>
