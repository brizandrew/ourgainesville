It's tolerant and accepting of all&nbsp;ethnicities, religions and sexual orientations. It's a safe haven for many.</p><p>This summer, WUFT reporters focused on a community-engagement project that highlights the rich diversity of the people who live here.&nbsp;</p><p>We asked them why they made Gainesville home. All of them came here for different reasons, but one thing has kept them here — it's a place where finally they belong.</p><p>The project,&nbsp;<em>Our Gainesville</em>, is comprised of individual stories of people living, working, praying, performing and more. It tells the stories of who we are, where we are and what we are. It shows what makes Gainesville, Gainesville.</p><p>But, it's just the beginning of what we hope is an ongoing conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wuftnews" title="" target="">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/WUFTNews" title="" target="">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wuftnews/" title="" target="">Instagram</a>&nbsp;and look for the the hashtag #ourgainesville.&nbsp;</p><p>Tell us what you think of the project and stories.
