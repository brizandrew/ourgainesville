You ready?”</p><p>McLinda Gilchrist’s 4-year-old great-grandson, Deville Mitchell, hops onto his Big Flyer tricycle and speeds off. His laughter fills the street. It’s high noon on a Sunday, but the heat doesn’t bother him.</p><p>Deville rushes down the dead-end street with his long, brown curly hair flying through the air. He makes a sharp U-turn and pedals back to his great-grandmother.</p><p>Gilchrist sits in her lawn chair in admiration.</p><p>“He can ride that thing so fast,” she says. “It amazes me how much energy he’s got.”</p><p>Gilchrist, 65, three of her grandchildren and two of her great-grandchildren live in a two-story townhome in the heart of the Linton Oaks neighborhood in Gainesville. She is known as the “mayor" of the neighborhood. Some even call her Grandma.</p><p>Gilchrist lives to serve her neighbors; she’s recognized by her big smile and cheerful spirit.</p><p>But sharing that smile isn't always easy. It’s a choice she makes every day, after a lifetime of loss.</p><p>She’s lost nine of her 17 siblings, both of her breasts to cancer, her mother, her husband, her daughter to prison and her family business to fire.</p><p>Yet despite the loss, Gilchrist finds a way to love her neighbors, to serve as the “mayor of Linton Oaks,” to act as a Grandma to those who need her, to lead by example.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://thisisatest7708.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_0647.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="McLinda Gilchrist plays with her great-grandson, Deville Mitchell, 4, in her Linton Oaks home.

It was a Sunday, and 9-year-old Gilchrist had just attended her mother’s funeral after she died in a car accident. The next day, Gilchrist would be working on her parents’ 500-acre farm in Bogue Chitto, Alabama, as if nothing happened. She was born and raised there and knew nothing other than farm life.</p><p>We had to keep on keepin’ on,” Gilchrist says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p> There was no time to grieve or be depressed or anything about that because you have got to keep going.



</p></blockquote><p>She was 17 years old when she had her first child. The same year, she left home with a few of her siblings and her daughter after growing tired of farm life.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://thisisatest7708.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/img_0665.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Gilchrist looks at pictures of her as a young girl.

She had two more children before moving to New York City in 1979 with her siblings.</p><p>She stayed there for 34 years, got married and worked at the family restaurant and as a secretary at the Young Women’s Christian Association.</p><p>As Gilchrist grew older, she missed the quiet and simple life she enjoyed growing up in Alabama. Separated from her husband and sick of the fast-paced New York lifestyle, Gilchrist packed up her 1993 Chevy Suburban and drove 1,059 miles —&nbsp;to her childhood home in Bogue Chitto.</p><p>She worked at the family grocery store until five years later, when it burned to the ground.</p><p>Gilchrist was left without a job.</p><p>For years, she had visited her daughter in Gainesville on the weekends. It was time to make the move.</p><p>"When she grew up the community was combined,” says Gilchrist's daughter, Sandra Kimbrough. “People knew who each other’s kids were, they looked out for each other, and we’ve gotten away from that so much. You can see it in our African-American community. You can see the results of not being a community, not being there for one another, not looking out for each other."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Gilchrist didn’t always plan on raising her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. In 2010, life took a turn when Kimbrough was involved in a murder and was sentenced to two years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>Kimbrough&nbsp;<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/355174611/Court-Documents" title="" target="">was found guilty as an accomplice</a> to murder, grand theft auto, abuse of a dead body, tampering with physical evidence and malicious land burning with her then boyfriend, Antonio Drayton. According to the Alachua County Sherrif's Office, on December 30, 2010, the body of University of Florida senior Saleha Huuda was found burning on the side of a road near the Gainesville Raceway. Kimbrough and Drayton were found guilty of killing her.</p><p>According to Gilchrist, Huuda had been involved with Drayton, but he had become abusive and Huuda tried to distance herself from him. Huuda had called the cops on Drayton before, and according to Gilchrist, he was tired of her reporting him.&nbsp;</p><p>Gilchrist says Drayton threatened to kill her daughter and her family if Kimbrough didn't help him with the murder of Huuda, and Kimbrough felt like she had no other option.&nbsp;</p><p>Kimbrough spent two years in prison. Drayton is still serving his 45-year sentence. Gilchrist took care of her grandchildren while her daughter was in prison and is still caring for them today.&nbsp;</p><p>“It made our family closer and we had to realize that she was gone,” Gilchrist says of her daughter. “I felt blessed she was still alive, because she could have been dead.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331361174&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Gilchrist volunteers for the Southwest Advocacy Group Resource Center, or SWAG. The center sits in the heart of Linton Oaks, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Gainesville. Linton Oaks has the highest child maltreatment rates in Alachua County, is the fifth most impoverished zip code in the area and sees some of the most domestic violence incidents, according to the <a href="http://http//swadvocacygroup.org/community-data/" title="">SWAG Center’s website</a>.</p><p>SWAG works to provide members of the community with a safe haven. The center has a health clinic, a children’s center, a food pantry and health programs. The center’s mission depends on volunteers like Gilchrist.</p><p>"She’s very willing to go the extra mile,” says Joan Canton, another SWAG volunteer."</p><blockquote class="center"><p>She would drive somebody somewhere and she would try to get resources for people. It makes a whole difference instead of somebody just telling you, ‘Well you should do this,’ but her attitude is, ‘This is what you need to do — tell me how I can help you do it.'

Her pain was not wasted though — Gilchrist uses it to inspire her grandchildren, her great-grandchildren and her neighbors.</p><p>“Someone has it worse than you,” Gilchrist says. “I’ve come to terms with that in life, through going through the cancer and seeing that without a doubt, other people had it way worse than me. So I dare think that I could be bitter or anything like that. It will make me sick again.”</p>
