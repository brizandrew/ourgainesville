He frames his shot through a small hole in the bone, focusing on a sandhill crane gliding across the sunset. <br></p><p>Batista, 68, has been capturing moments like this for more than 40 years as a professional photographer. His journey has taken him from Zion to Moscow, but it was in Cuba where he found his greatest inspiration — a cultural awakening that stirred so strongly he brought it back to Gainesville.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227803234"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>From 1954 to 1961, Batista lived with his family in Cuba. As a child he witnessed firsthand the violence and political instability that continues to plague the communist country. One neighbor was hanged, suspected a “sympathizer” to the revolution. Another was killed by a stray bullet.</p><p>For his own safety, his parents sent him to live with his grandparents on the outskirts of Tampa in 1961.</p><p>His father, Wilfredo, was not allowed to leave the country. His education, which included a master’s degree in soil science from the University of Florida, made him too valuable in the eyes of the Cuban government. Batista’s mother, Alfonsina, stayed behind to take care of him as he was suffering from Parkinson’s disease.<br></p><p>As Batista’s father’s condition worsened, his mother persuaded the government he was no longer an asset to the country. His parents left Cuba and reunited with Batista in Florida in 1963.<br></p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Randy Batista did not set foot on Cuban soil again for 35 years.</p><p>He returned for the first time in 1996.</p><p>The dilapidated conditions had an emotional impact on Batista.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Cuba_Iphone06_17_Tyler_Exhibition_-28.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Many buildings in Cuba are heavily weathered and without paint, like La Guarida, a restaurant.

Poverty stricken, no food, no meds, cars that had been running from 1957, buildings that had lacked paint. It was just a free canvas to photograph every imaginable, conceivable thing you could possibly think of. And I think that’s the alluring thing about Cuba, it literally has stood still."</p><p>Among the degraded infrastructure and automotive relics, Batista noticed an ingenuinity in the Cuban people. He marveled at how they rigged goods to survive.</p><p>He watched a man use a bicycle tire and hose to form an adapter for a power washer. Another turned a transformer into a welder. When a gas station didn't have electricity, Cubans connected the pump to a bicycle chain and manually siphoned it to the car.</p><p>That cars run at all in Cuba is a testament to the engineering prowess of these people.</p><p><pstyle="margin: 0px;="" font-size:="" 11px;="" line-height:="" normal;="" font-family:="" helvetica;="" -webkit-text-stroke-width:="" initial;="" -webkit-text-stroke-color:="" rgb(0,="" 0,="" 0);"="">“1958 and 1959 were the last of the cars that were brought into Cuba, so you see a lot of those throughout the country," Batista says. "Many nowadays will have a Spanish transmission or a Russian diesel engine. The cars have been totally rigged because the people couldn’t get American parts.”<br></pstyle="margin:></p><p>Batista set to work capturing as much as he could of the people and their creations, but he knew one trip would not be enough to document everything.</p><p>He has visited the island more than 15 times since 1996.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Batista owned a photography studio in downtown Gainesville beginning in 1974, but he closed its doors in 2013 and turned his focus to bringing Cuban culture back to share with the city he has called home for nearly 50 years.</p><p>First in documentaries; then with people.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/329009379&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>He brought Cuban artists — dancers, painters, singers, writers, filmmakers — to share with the community.</p><p>He created a festival, “Bulla Cubana,” to showcase Cuba’s diverse talent.</p><p>“Bulla” meaning an uproarious noise, which Batista endearingly attributes to the Cuban people.</p><p>The Bulla Cubana artists performed for the first time in January, kicking off three months of festivities scattered around Gainesville that filled galleries at the Harn Museum and permeated the streets of downtown with the sounds of conga drums and smells of moros y cristianos and tostones (rice and beans and deep-fried plantain slices).</p><p>Seasoned immigrants like Raquel Vallejo told their stories of love, loss and reconnection with Cuba. Many left with nothing during the tumultuous 1960s and were forced to restart in America. Some came to find a home in Gainesville.</p><figure class="img right"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_2441.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="(From left to right) Painter Miguel Machado, ballet dancer Jessie Dominguez and artist Juan Travieso stand in front of a freshly painted mural as part of the 352walls public art project in Gainesville.

Machado is a 28-year-old painter from Havana whose work has been exhibited in galleries across the United States. Travieso, 30, is also an internationally recognized painter who was born in Havana, but he moved to New York at a young age.</p><p>Their similarities inspired Vallejo, who is on the advisory committee for Bulla Cubana, to pair the two for a mural project.</p><p>"I wanted to prove that culture is a uniting force," Vallejo says. "Same generation — one living in Cuba, one living outside."</p><p>Vallejo says the two artists became dear friends, like brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Batista believes Cuba has more to offer than a history lesson.</p><p>He wants to put Gainesville on the map as a mecca of Cuban art and culture. </p><p>“And this is only the beginning,” Batista says with the urgency of someone trying to make up for lost time.</p><p>For the people who struggled and still struggle, “art and culture was like their lollipop,” Batista says. “This is what they lived for.”</p>
