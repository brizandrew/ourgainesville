Born in rural St. Lucia in 1969 with very little, she learned to embrace adversity as it came, whether it was moving to a different country or starting over at the age of 44.</p><p>It was these challenges that took her from the small island 1,600 miles south of Florida to a mansion on 8th Ave. in Gainesville.</p><p>“My whole life has just been adapting to different situations and circumstances,” Concessa said. “I know the situation that I’m in is better than where I came from.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Concessa grew up on the poor side of the nine-mile-wide island. Her family owned a banana farm, where she and her four siblings worked when they weren’t at school. Growing up without electricity or running water, they used charcoal and wood for all their cooking.</p><p>As a young girl on the island, she was surrounded by alcoholics. Both of her parents routinely had marital affairs and their moral values often contradicted their actions. While her father banned her from running track in high school because he thought the uniforms were too revealing, he failed to protect her from the men who would linger in and around her home.&nbsp;</p><p>Concessa simply describes her childhood as "island life," a culture of infidelity and apathy. She had no way out until 1986, when she met Kim Bowman.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa, 18, stands with Kim, 28 in St. Lucia in 1987.

Raised in a predominately black community and country, their only previous knowledge of white people came from the television shows “Dallas” and “Knots Landing.” She and her siblings would watch these shows every week at a friend’s house where there was a TV.</p><p>To a teenage Concessa, these shows presented a fantasy world. Her idea of white people and of America stemmed from the lavish houses and luxury cars she watched on the black-and-white 14-inch screen.</p><p>So when the 27-year-old Cornell graduate took an interest in Concessa, the community in St. Lucia saw her as the “chosen one.” She faced immense pressure from her family to marry him, as they saw her opportunity to leave as their own path to the American dream.</p><p>Concessa felt like she had no other option.</p><p>At 17, I didn’t know what love was,” she said. “</p><blockquote class="center"><p>But it was my mom sitting me down on the bed in our home and saying ‘This is what you will do for the family.’ So I felt like I just went along with that plan.




</p></blockquote><p>That plan brought her to Gainesville in 1987. The Bowmans spent the next 13 years hopping around various cities in Florida and California before settling in Vero Beach, where they would spend the next seven years together. During this time, Concessa and Kim had three children together and joined the Community Church of Vero Beach. It was at church that Concessa would see the end of one chapter of her life and the beginning of another.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Having grown up in St. Lucia, Concessa never really knew any other culture. Her only idea of marriage came from her parents. These views changed when the church appointed her deacon.</p><p>As Concessa met more families in the congregation, she got a glimpse of what a strong marriage looked like. This caused her to question her own.</p><p>Concessa felt trapped.</p><p>"I literally felt like I was in a prison at home," she said. "He never looked at me as an equal. I was just the thing he married. I was his puppet."</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa10-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa and Kim stand with their children Garrett, Deanna and Karina in front of their home in Vero Beach.

While she wasn’t very fast and couldn’t run long distances at first, she loved running. It helped her think. And over time, she saw herself get stronger and faster.</p><p>She discovered if she practiced and committed herself to running, she would eventually get better. Concessa applied this same logic to her everyday life.</p><p>“Considering I couldn’t even run for a mile, to see how the body changed and my way of thinking had changed to actually do a 10k or a 5k … I could do that with my life, and apply those same techniques with taking steps to ending my marriage and how I did that was my way of communication with God,” she said. “I call it my therapy, just to escape in that way of thinking for the time that I was running so that I could then come back and apply what I’ve been thinking about to my daily life with my marriage and with everything that I did.”</p><p>She ended her marriage with Kim.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225312548"></iframe><figcaption>Concessa Jean-Marie Bowman shares what she's accomplished through cooking.</figcaption></figure><p>Concessa continued her work at the church, helping organize softball games and dinners. One night, as the church prepared for a community dinner, their chef didn’t show. When she called him, he told her he was in South Carolina and would not be returning. Thinking this couldn’t be much different than cooking for her husband and children, she took over the kitchen and prepared a meal for 75 members of the church.</p><p>The success of that night inspired her. She attended night classes for six months, earned her ServSafe chef's certification and started working as a chef at Christ by the Sea United Methodist Church in Vero Beach while also operating her own catering service.</p><p>Her new career path eventually lead her back to Gainesville— where her life in the U.S. first started.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa4-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa talks with the other chefs at Camp Kulaqua in High Springs, Florida, where she typically works when she's not cooking at Tri-Delta.

(Spencer Thompson/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>Just before Concessa moved, she sent 20 letters to different churches in the area hoping to land another position as a chef. Trinity United Methodist Church responded first. After working there for two months, she got a call from the Tri-Delta sorority. They asked if she was interested in becoming their new head chef. Without even knowing what a sorority was at the time, Concessa immediately said yes.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328247278&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tri-Delta sorority sisters and bus boys share love for their "Gainesville Mom."</figcaption></figure><p>Now, she cooks for nearly 200 girls everyday. But she does much more than just cook for them. Considered their “Gainesville Mom” by some, Concessa comforts them, laughs with them and guides them.</p><p>“Whenever we have problems, she’s obviously like one of those therapist-type people, like a hairdresser, you go and talk to her and load all your problems on her,” UF graduate and Tri-Delt sister Chandler Cartwright said. “She’s really good about listening.”</p><p>With her children spread out across Florida and her family more than 1,000 miles away, Concessa has never felt more at home.</p><p>When her sorority girls leave for home over the summer, Concessa looks for part-time work, as the Tri-Delta house sits empty. This summer she took a temporary cooking job at the Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Maine.</p><p>When she arrived, she was assigned a cabin. Above the green door frame, two words hung on a plaque:</p><p>“Without Limits.”</p><p>“Pretty fitting,” she said. “Don’t you think?”</p>
