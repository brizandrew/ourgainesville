Wearing his signature white electric guitar suspenders, Blake performs the “Tom Show” for his core of regulars during happy hour.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake prepares a drink during happy hour at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville, Fl.(Photo by Chris Watkins)"><figcaption>Tom Blake prepares a drink during happy hour at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville, Fl.(Photo by Chris Watkins)</figcaption></figure><p>Alcohol flows as Stevie Ray Vaughan blasts from the jukebox glowing in the corner. The smell of popcorn and cigarette smoke lingers in the air. Blake dances between pouring drinks and creating conversation, never missing a beat.</p><p>Before his 35-year career as the happy hour bartender at Lillian’s Music Store, and before he wrote and published his “Exile” series of novels documenting his life experiences, Blake and his rock-n-roll band “The Dead Dog” were almost famous. With Johnny Poontang as the lead singer they toured France in the late '70s.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.




</p></blockquote><p>“People used to ask us, why was an American band trying to make it in France,” Blake says. “We would always explain to them, if we are going to go around the block and try to make it as a band, we thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.”</p><p>In retrospect, Blake says that this was a good decision.</p><p>Blake and Johnny formed “The Dead Dog” and they toured Europe for three years.</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-5.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake plays his Gibson 335 guitar that he has had since he played with his rock-n-roll band, “The Dead Dog,” in France.

Blake performed his opening instrumental piece, and as if on cue, Johnny walked out onto the stage with a look on his face of I’ll explain later.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.

</p></blockquote><p>“That night we played the best show of our career,” Blake says. “We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.”</p><p>After the show, Johnny explained that he had broken up with Gava, and that he had informed her that he didn't think that the band needed her help getting gigs anymore.</p><p>This caused a rupture in the band for a while, Blake says. Without Gava’s help “The Dead Dog” struggled to book more gigs.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331370008&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake talks about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang.</figcaption></figure><p> Now 36 years after “The Dead Dog” toured Europe, Blake reminisces about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang, while he was a student at the University of Virginia.</p><p>“My first encounter with Johnny Poontang was when the University of Virginia was still a very conservative university,” Blake says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.

</p></blockquote><p>Johnny and a friend were running for student government under the anarchist party ticket. Their campaign poster was a picture of Johnny and his friend holding a cartoon bomb, like the one that Yosemite Sam sported in the “Looney Toons” cartoon series. With the slogan of, “vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.”</p><p>Johnny didn’t win the election, but he and Blake formed a lifelong friendship and bonded over music.</p><p>In January of 1979, after graduating from the University of Virginia and spending three years struggling to make it big in France, Blake, his girlfriend Genevieve and Johnny Poontang all piled into a car heading from Geneva, Switzerland, back to Aix-en-Provence, the band's home base in the south of France, with Johnny at the wheel.</p><p> “We were heading, we thought to the south of France,” Blake says. “But we noticed the smell of mustard in the air, which meant that we were outside the town of Dijon.”</p><p>Instead of driving south toward Aix-en-Provence, Johnny intentionally drove north to the city of Dijon.</p><p> Johnny pulled over at a truck stop on the edge of town and told Blake and Genevieve that he had to return to America to secure more funding for the band. He got out of the car and walked to the nearest truck, knocked on the window and told the driver, “tu va à Paris.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-4.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake with his wife, Genevieve, enjoying an afternoon with friends at One Love Café in Gainesville.

After several months and no sign of Johnny, it became apparent that he was not coming back.</p><p> So, the two packed their bags and moved to Virginia. There Blake put together another band with a local guitar player named Ziggy. “At that point, we played around Charlottesville for about a year, and Genevieve said it’s time to try to make it again,” Blake says.</p><p>The three of them packed their bags and headed to Jamaica. There they lived in the guest quarters at Genevieve’s father’s estate in Montego Bay. To make ends meet they worked at a small deli named Little John’s Deli, where Blake and Genevieve made sandwiches and Ziggy worked nights washing dishes. Soon Ziggy got cold feet, left the band and returned to his studies at the University of Virginia.</p><p>Shortly after Ziggy’s departure, they discovered that Genevieve was pregnant with the first of their three children, son Gabriel.</p><p>Blake and Genevieve quickly moved to the closest college town, Gainesville, Florida.</p><p>“I’ve always lived in college towns and the greatest thing about college towns is the intergenerational mixture and the greatest level of tolerance that can exist in college towns,” Blake says.</p><p>The two coasted into town on fumes, broke and nearly homeless.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake and his wife Genevieve on their wedding day outside of the Alachua County Courthouse.

</p></blockquote><p>“I don’t think that anyone sets out to become a bartender,” Blake says. Every time that he steps behind the bar, it is a performance, and to Blake that is what makes bartending a great job.</p><p>Blake has been performing what he calls “The Tom Show” at Lillian’s happy hour since 1983. He serves drinks and creates conversation among regulars, many of whom say that they come to Lillian’s because of Blake.</p><p>Blake is what has kept Wade Hurt coming back for nearly 35 years.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226193215"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake, the happy hour bartender from Lillian's Music Store talks about his 35-year carrier as a bartender.</figcaption></figure><p>Chances are that if you are a regular to Lillian’s happy hour, Blake will greet you by your nickname when you walk through the door.</p><p>Blake says that since “The Tom Show” is based on the people who came into the bar and the character that they possess, the nicknames came naturally.</p><p>“The nicknames are terms of endearment that capture part of who you are in an ironic way, or a humorous way,” Blake said.</p><p>Take “Dr. Dirt” for example. Wayde Hurt, or “Dr. Dirt,” as Blake refers to him, is a retired soil scientist and UF professor from Mississippi. “But, when you are a soil scientist from Mississippi, ‘I am just a professor of dirt’,” Blake says.</p><p>Blake attributes his success at bartending to being able to drawing conversation out of anyone who sits down at the bar.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-8-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake speaks with customers from behind the bar at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville.
