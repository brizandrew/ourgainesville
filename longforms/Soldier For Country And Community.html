built with his fellow military men, the blood shed in battle. </p><p>The Marine Corps gave him the structure, discipline and
patriotism he would need for the rest of his life.</p><p>Bob Gasche, 92, left the Battle of Iwo Jima and pursued a life
of service as an educator, businessman and leader in the veteran community.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Gasche-3.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Gasche holds a picture of his younger self in dungarees, with a cartridge belt on his left shoulder, and a M1 Garand .30 caliber rifle on his right shoulder.

shores of Iwo Jima on D-Day, Feb. 19, 1945. The American troops invaded the
coarse black sand beach with the mission of crossing the narrow neck of the
island —&nbsp;700 yards of hell.</p><p>The main objective was to secure the Motoyama Airfield #1,
which was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, for the American superbombers
arriving from the mainland Japan.</p><p>The Japanese army was positioned atop Mount Suribachi and immersed in underground tunnels, built by about 300 mining engineers under the command of
General Kuribayashi. </p><p>It was during a raid in one of these tunnels that enemy
shrapnel struck Gasche's belt buckle, causing shattered brass to pierce his abdomen.</p><p>Gasche was evacuated and sent to multiple doctors only to be
told that the metal would eventually find its own way out of his body.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Gasche-9.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Gasche wears his Marine Corps League sunburst insignia, Purple Heart Patch, various awarded military ribbons, Marine Corps Rifle Expert Badge, and an embroidered image of the flag raising on Mt.

Act of 1944, also known as the G.I. Bill. The bill gave benefits to returning veterans, including paying for college tuition. </p><p>After the war Gasche moved to South Florida to pursue an education at the University of Miami. At the same time, he worked
full-time at Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company in Miami.</p><p>He started as a customer service representative. He drove a
company car and went into the community, going door-to-door to provide his
services. </p><p>Gasche earned his bachelor's degree in business administration and
originally planned to stay with Southern Bell and work his way up in the ranks,
but he realized his true calling was to work with young people. </p><p>"I wanted to work with the young people of America," Gasche says. "And tell them about our country and how I felt about the significance of our heritage."</p><p>With that in mind, and his love for history, Gasche returned
to UM to pursue a master’s degree in education with a concentration in history.</p><p>He started his teaching career at Ponce de Leon Junior High School in Miami and also taught at Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral
Gables, Florida. </p><p>An intern that Gasche oversaw at Ponce de Leon spoke of him
to a professor at the University of Florida, earning him an interview for a
teacher position through the university's College of Education.</p><p>In 1968, Gasche moved with his wife and three children to
Gainesville to teach at P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School. He retired as the school's Director of Learning Resources after 20 years with UF’s College of Education.</p><p>Gasche felt that he could help young people along through his teachings in civics, history, topical geography, social studies and
media.</p><p>“I really enjoyed the responsibility of being a teacher and
I said, ‘This is it. This is my career,’” Gasche says.</p><p>”I went to great extent to throw myself into the realm of
education. In fact, it was something I wish I’d done earlier,” Gasche says.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227197880"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Along with another teacher from P.K.

Gasche started the Florisun Company, a landscaping business. </p><p>It began as something to do during the summertime but then

estate agent. Muller notified Gasche of houses that needed maintenance work
done.</p><p>The two, along with crew members, performed an assortment of
services like painting, maintenance and landscaping, which Gasche would sketch
and consult with the homeowners.</p><p>Gasche and DuPree had no former experience but started the
company with “a gallonized bucket and rags.”</p><p>Muller gave them more jobs to complete, and soon other real
estate agents heard of their work.</p><p>“I told every guy that I hired that when we leave a
property, it had to be in better shape than when we came,” Gasche says, “and
never touch anything that doesn’t belong to you.”</p><p>Gasche treated his customers with respect and showed his
integrity by making sure the job was done to the homeowner’s satisfaction. </p><p>We were honest," he says. "I don’t know how to be any other way.</p><p>His work ethic led him to serve as the chairman and
founder of Keep Alachua County Beautiful. KACB is an affiliate of Keep America
Beautiful, the
largest community-improvement nonprofit organization in the United States,

that fought at Iwo Jima during World War II: Clif Cormier of the 3rd Marine Division, Clair Chaffin of
the 4th Marine Division, and Gasche. The
organization holds monthly meetings to discuss a range of topics from
involvement in community veteran affairs to VA benefits.</p><p>Gasche collects old American flags to dispose of them properly,
he serves as master of ceremonies for events on Memorial Day, and provides
involvement opportunities in veteran affairs for students with an organization he co-founded, the Milton Lewis Young Marines.</p><p>As Gasche likes to say, his life’s work has been a labor of
love.</p>
