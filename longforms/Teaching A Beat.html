</p></blockquote><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Moments like this are frequent for the 46-year-old music director at Sidney Lanier Center, a school for kids with disabilities in Gainesville.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>His love for music, cultivated during childhood, led him to share his passion with the world. It led him to Haiti, where's he's worked with the disabled at a Port-au-Prince orphanage. It led him to Sidney Lanier, where he's made a difference in the lives of his students teaching them music one beat at a time.</p><p>“It’s tiring, and there’s a lot of patience that comes with the things we do,” DeVito says. “But the best part of my job, I feel like, is when I get those little minute advances from a student. We look for the minute that we can take and build upon.”<br></p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/don-w-pifano-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Although the flute is his favorite instrument, DeVito opts to play the pifano while teaching.

DeVito has traded his khaki pants and navy Sidney Lanier polo for shorts and a T-shirt. He’s playing songs on his pifano.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>It looks and sounds like a flute, but it is higher pitched. DeVito plays the flute’s lesser-known cousin because of its durability. When he first visited Haiti in 2010, it was his pifano he brought along.</p><p>He’s planning a sixth trip to Haiti, this time to open the Haitian Center for Inclusive Education. DeVito has worked to develop the center with Gertrude BienAmie, who runs the Notre Maison orphanage.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/IMG_0374-e1501789545860.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="DeVito with BienAmie (left) and Lina Cloutier (center) at her graduation from Sidney Lanier in May.

We have flutes the kids are playing. We were not doing that before Don came. I would say the kids are learning instruments because of Don. And when he comes, he never stops teaching the kids."</p><p>But it's not just the kids who are learning from DeVito.</p><p>"They [the teachers] were saying things like, 'I would turn my head
when I was walking down the street because I would be scared of a person with a
disability — now I see they’re people,'” Devito says.<br></p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328427699&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>(Photo: Haitian Center for Inclusive Education, courtesy of Don DeVito.)</figcaption></figure><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Music framed DeVito's childhood. His father set up stereo and eight-track tape systems in his son's bedroom. With a diverse collection of genres at his fingertips, DeVito immersed himself into a world of rhythms, beats and melodies.</p><p>"I would sit up there with my headphones on, and I would conduct with my No. 2 pencil,” DeVito recalls. “I would just go from everything from big band music to jazz to movie music. Italian music, just all kinds of variety."</p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">His mother enrolled him in guitar lessons at age 5 after realizing the frequent strumming of an air guitar around the house just wouldn’t do.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>Music quickly became DeVito’s favorite subject in school.<br></p><p>“For being in a small county, I had a very rich musical experience in the public school system,” he says, “and then I decided that’s really what I want to do.”</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/FullSizeRender-4.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Mr. Grad's Flagler Palm Coast High School Band Ensemble featuring DeVito, 1984 (Courtesy of Don DeVito)"><figcaption>Mr. Grad's Flagler Palm Coast High School Band Ensemble featuring DeVito, 1984 (Courtesy of Don DeVito)</figcaption></figure><p>His band director of eight years left the biggest impact on him. Mr. Grad, clad in a suit every day and equipped with a dry sense of humor, pushed his students to play songs beyond the capability of their tiny ensemble.<br></p><p>They didn’t have a bassoon, but if a song required one, Mr. Grad made do. When the ensemble played at festivals, DeVito heard comments like, “Nice bassoon solo.”</p><p>“It was actually being played on an alto saxophone,” he recalls. “That’s just what we had. They’re not anywhere near identical instruments.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Sixteen years ago, DeVito sat in his 1996 brown Geo Prizm at a stop sign on Depot Avenue. That crossroad, that stop sign, that moment, could be described as his intersection of life.</p><p>At the time, he was working on his doctorate in music education at the University of Florida. He was driving to the Sidney Lanier Center to observe a class of music students with special needs, but couldn’t find the school.<br></p><p>He could have gone right and visited the nearby P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School.<br></p><p>“I came to this stop sign, and I said, OK, I can go left and try and find Lanier, or I can go right and go back and I’ll just do P.K. Yonge,” he says. “You always have those moments, sometimes you have those moments where you can pinpoint, and I said, 'I’ll try one more time.' So I made a left. I found it.”</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226158155"></iframe><figcaption>DeVito discusses the importance of knowing how to keep a beat. (Rachel Rockwell/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>It was that left turn that led him to teaching.</p><p>It was that left turn that brought him to a group of kids who needed him, needed someone to believe in them the way “Mr. D” does.</p><p>DeVito likes to emphasize the importance of personal growth to his students.<br></p><p>“It’s not based on the student trying to get to a hundred percent,” he says. "It’s based on where are you now, where are you tomorrow, where are you the next day.”</p><p>As a kindergartener bored with four-piece puzzles, he attempted a more difficult 16-piece version. He couldn’t do it, but instead of encouragement, his teacher asked, “If you couldn’t do it, why did you try?”</p><p>That just kind of stuck in my mind,” DeVito says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Now, as a teacher, I think back to that exchange and think ‘Wow, what a wrong thing to say.’





</p></blockquote><p>Teaching is a two-way street for him. He learns as much from his students as they do from him.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his first students at Sidney Lanier was Brian, a boy with Down syndrome, who answered DeVito’s question of “Are you ready” with, “I was born ready.”<br></p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Brian may not have been immediately successful at what he did, but he was ready to try, and that’s an attitude DeVito encounters often in his students.&nbsp;</pdir="ltr"></p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">He says they’re always the first ones to get up at weddings and social gatherings to dance and sing.</pdir="ltr"></p><p><b>"</b>I've watched my students in all of these types of settings, and the way they embrace life and never miss an opportunity to make the most of it, I think, is one of their greatest skills and the thing I have learned from them."<br></p>
