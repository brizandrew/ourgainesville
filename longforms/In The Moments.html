On Saturdays, his parents woke up much earlier than he did. They usually had already eaten breakfast and started their day. But he knew where to find them — sitting in the living room transfixed on the sounds emitting from a spinning vinyl record.</p><p>Bob Dylan. Bruce Springsteen. His mom really liked Barbra Streisand, and his dad went through a Kris Kristofferson phase.</p><p>“That showed me early on that music is for enjoyment, but it is also this crazy vehicle that can bring you back to a time when you were a teenager, in the present or up to the future,” Fiorello says.<br></p><p>"That’s the cool thing about music, it lets you ride around in that vehicle through time and space."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Fiorello co-owns a tattoo shop, produces custom vinyls and designs silicon collectible toys, but most know him from his 25-year career touring the world as the drummer and lyricist for the Gainesville ska-punk band, Less Than Jake.</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/becomingyogiblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/fiorello_hist3.jpg?ssl=1&amp;w=450" data-sizes="auto" alt="Fiorello performing on the drums at The House of Blues in San Diego during Less Than Jake's 20-year anniversary tour.

His ability to recognize and take advantage of these "pulls" as opportunities is what makes him intuitive, creative and successful.</p><p>Less Than Jake has released more than 300 albums and songs, created merchandise from chapstick to ice scrapers and stepped on six continents, some of them twice. In the early '90s, they were just a group of college students, booking their own shows and traveling to nearby cities and states in a borrowed industrial paint van.</p><p>They would utilize breaks from school to travel while they were attending classes.</p><p>Fiorello remembers using this time on the road to write titles of songs, lyrics and ideas to explore. Generally, he used napkins or any other small scraps of papers and then tucked them into his socks so he wouldn’t lose them.</p><p>At the end of the night I’d be some weird guy taking off his shoes," he says. "And there would be little bits of paper everywhere.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>One of Fiorello’s first pivotal “pulls” was in the fall of 1991, when he moved to Gainesville to start Less than Jake with his childhood friend Chris DeMakes. Three new members joined and they played their first show the last week of August.</p><p>Only a few months prior the band was still nameless, made up of only two out of the eventual five members and trying to record a demo. DeMakes was driving from Gainesville to Port Charlotte every weekend to meet with Fiorello.</p><p>“We would go in the back room of my parents house with this four-track and write songs and try to record songs and do whatever,” Fiorello says.</p><p>Fiorello’s parents often made them stop because it would upset their 80-pound English bulldog, Jake.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331962037&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The dog was above everything.</p><p>“That was the first time anyone outside of the family saw it where like there’d be a seat on the couch that you couldn’t sit at because it would just be for the dog,” Fiorello says.</p><p>The two finished their demo that summer. Fiorello packaged 25 cassette copies and sent them to DeMakes to hand out at punk rock shows in Gainesville.</p><p>Each one read: <b>“Less Than Jake” four song demo.</b></p><p>DeMakes opened the package and immediately called Fiorello.</p><p>“What the hell does Less Than Jake mean?” he asked.</p><p>"I don’t know, we are less than the dog. You know?” Fiorello told him.&nbsp;</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Mom and Dad make us stop practicing when we are in the back room because the dog is howling, and it’s too noisy, and you know I get fed mac and cheese when they cook the dog steak. So we are less than Jake.
</p></blockquote><p>DeMakes remembers hanging up thinking that it was the “the stupidest thing in the world.”</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/becomingyogiblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/fiorello_hist1.jpg?ssl=1&amp;w=450" data-sizes="auto" alt="(Photo courtesy of Vinnie Fiorello)"><figcaption>(Photo courtesy of Vinnie Fiorello)</figcaption></figure><p>Less Than Jake eventually signed with Capitol Records in 1996. Bigger doors were opening, allowing them to tour places like Europe and Japan.</p><p>Fiorello was 25 and six months into his first job as a teacher, but he quit.</p><p>"Sometimes you have to let moments pull you."</p><p>“You can’t go back and get it. If you sort of feel that gravitational pull forward, you have to recognize that it is happening, and then you have to let it happen," he says.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>The band’s influence was so prominent that Fiorello’s wife, Darcy Dugan, got a Less Than Jake tattoo on her back as a teenager after attending one of the band’s shows in Gainesville.</p><p>The two wouldn’t meet for another year.</p><p>She became a fan during her freshman year in high school but, by the time she turned 19, she was ready to part with the extensive collection of vinyls and merchandise she had gathered over the years. She wanted them all to go to a good place, so she contacted the band hoping they would give them to other fans.</p><figure class="img right"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/becomingyogiblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/fiorello_family1.jpg?ssl=1&amp;w=450" data-sizes="auto" alt="Fiorello and his wife Darcy Dugan with their dog Marley.

Instead of selling them on eBay,” Fiorello says.</p><p>Fiorello sent her free tickets to a show that came through her hometown in Ohio.</p><p>That was the evening they first met. The same “pull” that brought Fiorello to Gainesville and made him quit his teaching job was happening again.</p><p>“As soon as we met, I knew it was one of those things. There was that magnetism. I can’t explain it. It just exists,” he says.</p><p>It was the first time it was easy. Easy to talk. Easy to hang out. Easy to just be.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Fiorello never imagined owning a tattoo shop that is also a home to toys and vinyl records produced by his company, Paper and Plastik. It wasn't until his now business partner Eric Jazvek started a candy-inspired tattoo sleeve on Fiorello's right arm.<br></p><p>The Willy Wonka quote, “Invention, my dear friends, is 93% perspiration, 6% electricity, 4% evaporation, and 2% butterscotch ripple” carries throughout the piece.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226912804"></iframe><figcaption>Fiorello Talks About The Inspiration Behind His Tattoos.</figcaption></figure><p>For several hours, Jazvek etched gingerbread houses, marching gummy bears, godzilla PEZ dispensers and peppermint UFO’s into Fiorello’s arm. They discussed developing a creative hub that would be a nest for ideas for all types of art forms.</p><p>"When you are able to accept your failures and you can take little successes, then you start to recognize when things are right,” Fiorello says. “You go ‘OK’ and let it pull you."</p><p>It resulted in the tattoo shop, Wunderland Custom Tattooing, with a waiting room that is bursting with the vibrant colors of designer toys and the shop’s candle line expressing hints of kaffir lime, deep woods and fog. The sounds of tattoo guns buzz through the hallways where guitars and skateboard decks hang between watercolor paintings and oil illustrations.</p><p>“His ideas go from conception to reality. Once they are in reality he nurtures them and is able to send them out into the world. He’s so cool,” Jazvek says. “He is endlessly creative. He’s very much like Willy Wonka.”</p>
