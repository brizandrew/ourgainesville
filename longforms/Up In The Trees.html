But Gene persisted.<br></p><p>“Can you cure me of colorblindness?” he asked the physician. An array of flashing colors popped in front of him in a dark room. He wasn’t cured, but he had a memory.

A tire swing sways in the distance, a playhouse sits ready for games, and a turkey slowly cooks. The family, together for their annual Thanksgiving feast, stands around an empty patch of land on the Liddons’ tree farm.
