Throughout elementary school, college and even now, the Miles' home came to be a place where friends were welcomed with open arms, but they learned quickly that time spent with Phoebe Miles was unpredictable.</p><p>When Elena Miles was in high school, she remembers her mom calling her outside to race toy sailboats powered by lighting cashews on fire.</p><p>And when her mother came to visit her at Wheaton College, she persuaded her daughter's college friends to participate in a dance illustrating what the sodium pump does to your kidneys.</p><p>“All of a sudden I was dancing around pretending to be sugar entering into a sodium pump while my friend was sodium potassium,” she said. “It was ridiculous, but it was very fun.”</p><p>All of it is quintessential Phoebe Miles.</p><p>“I think it’s in her blood,” Elena Miles said. “The Cade Thing.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_0578.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles sits in the patio of her parents' Gainesville home.

Cade was the leader of the team that invented Gatorade in 1965, the sports drink turned sideline staple and global phenomenon.</p><p>The museum opens to the public in the spring of 2018, but for 12 years, Phoebe Miles has pushed it along from concept to construct. She feels it’s her job – her calling – to tell the story of Gainesville.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>One of my motivating factors and the reason I feel I’m called to do this is I thought it was so spectacular to grow up with a father as an inventor,” she said. “I was exposed to so many things. Every day was kind of exciting.
        </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Cade was a gardener, tending to roses and citrus trees in the backyard, and a musician, playing the violin, while his daughter accompanied him on the piano.</p><p>Cade would shut down parties to recite poems from memory, embarrassing his daughter. As an adult, those memories astound her.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“And he must have had them grouped in his mind according to type of event,” she said. “He had funny poems. He had serious poems. He could quote ‘The Raven’ from memory. And sometimes you would have to listen to that.”</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226794764"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At times, he would load his family into one of his antique Studebakers and drive to a Dipper Dan ice cream shop, where each child was allowed a double dip of ice cream.<br></p><p>He liked to get lost, finding his way back home along country roads.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was a romantic," she said. "So if you were out in the middle of a field in a Studebaker and a lightning storm came, it was just the best. Especially if you got lost."</p><p>Phoebe Miles said Cade was a lifelong Lutheran and often spoke of the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was kind of his guiding philosophy, she said:</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If I can help and I have the means to help, that’s what I need to do.

His parents told him if he could find not only a family to live with, but also parents who would act as his legal guardians for his last year, he could finish out high school in Gainesville.</p><p>That’s where the Cade family came in.</p><p>“During the course of that year is when we fell in love,” Phoebe Miles said.<br></p><p>Richard Miles, a retired foreign service officer, said his wife is enthusiastic about making things happen.</p><p>“Well, she’s very energetic,” he said. “She cares deeply about ideas.”</p><p>In high school, he said, she was voted “Most Likely To Spontaneously Combust,” a joke award of sorts, but also a tribute to the never-ending questions she had that could make teachers crazy.<br></p><p>“Even in high school, you know, if it was just a bunch of high-school kids sitting around, Phoebe would usually be the one that would come up with the idea of what we were going to do that day or what place we should go and so on,” he said. “So her house, when we were growing up in high school, was that house that everyone kind of congregates around, because we knew something would be going on at the Cade’s house.”</p><p>Elena Miles, the youngest of Phoebe and Richard Miles’ three children, said her own childhood home was “the hangout house," where her mother was quick to invite friends into one of her experiments or projects.</p><p>"She’s just so inclusive of everybody and so eager to learn about everybody," she said.<br></p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Phoebe-Miles.jpeg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles shows off a speaker that children will make in classes at the Cade Museum with an electromagnetic coil.

Born in rural St. Lucia in 1969 with very little, she learned to embrace adversity as it came, whether it was moving to a different country or starting over at the age of 44.</p><p>It was these challenges that took her from the small island 1,600 miles south of Florida to a mansion on 8th Ave. in Gainesville.</p><p>“My whole life has just been adapting to different situations and circumstances,” Concessa said. “I know the situation that I’m in is better than where I came from.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Concessa grew up on the poor side of the nine-mile-wide island. Her family owned a banana farm, where she and her four siblings worked when they weren’t at school. Growing up without electricity or running water, they used charcoal and wood for all their cooking.</p><p>As a young girl on the island, she was surrounded by alcoholics in her family and community. Both of her parents routinely had marital affairs and their moral values often contradicted their actions. While her father banned her from running track in high school because he thought the uniforms were too revealing, he failed to protect her from the men who would linger in and around her home. She had no way out until 1986, when she met Kim Bowman.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="A 17-year-old Concessa stands with 27-year-old Kim in 1986.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>Volunteering with the Peace Corps., Kim came to St. Lucia from Gainesville. Concessa and her family worshipped him because he was white. Raised in a predominately black community and country, their only previous knowledge of white people came from the television shows “Dallas” and “Knots Landing.” She and her siblings would watch these shows every week at a friend’s house where there was a TV.</p><p>When the 27-year-old UF Ph.D. student took an interest in Concessa, the community in St. Lucia saw her as the “chosen one.” She faced immense pressure from her family to marry him, as they saw her opportunity to leave as their own path to the American dream.</p><p>Concessa felt like she had no other option.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>At 17, I didn’t know what love was,” she said. “But it was my mom sitting me down on the bed in our home and saying ‘This is what you will do for the family.’ So I felt like I just went along with that plan.
        </p></blockquote><p>That plan brought her to Gainesville in 1987. The Bowmans spent the next 13 years hopping around various Florida cities before settling in Vero Beach, where they would spend the next seven years together. During this time, Concessa and Kim had three children together and joined the Community Church of Vero Beach. It was at church that Concessa would see the end of one chapter of her life and the beginning of another.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Having grown up around abusive, alcoholic men in St. Lucia, Concessa never really knew any different. Her only idea of marriage came from her parents. These views changed when the church appointed her deacon.</p><p>As Concessa met more families in the congregation, she got a glimpse of what a strong marriage looked like. She began to question her own. It reminded her of the relationships she knew growing up.</p><p>She felt trapped.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa10-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa and Kim stand with their children Garrett, Deanna and Karina in front of the Community Church of Vero Beach.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>As she continued to contemplate her marriage, she also developed a passion for running. While she wasn’t very fast and couldn’t run long distances at first, she loved running. It helped her think. And over time, she saw herself get stronger and faster.</p><p>She discovered if she practiced and committed herself to running, she would eventually get better. Concessa applied this same logic to her everyday life.</p><p>“Considering I couldn’t even run for a mile, to see how the body changed and my way of thinking had changed to actually do a 10k or a 5k … I could do that with my life, and apply those same techniques with taking steps to ending my marriage and how I did that was my way of communication with God,” she said. “I call it my therapy, just to escape in that way of thinking for the time that I was running so that I could then come back and apply what I’ve been thinking about to my daily life with my marriage and with everything that I did.”</p><p>She ended her marriage with Kim.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225312548"></iframe><figcaption>Concessa Jean-Marie Bowman shares what she's accomplished through cooking.</figcaption></figure><p>Concessa continued her work at the church, helping organize bible studies and dinners. One night, as the church prepared for a community dinner, their chef didn’t show. When she called him, he told her he was in South Carolina and would not be returning. Thinking this couldn’t be much different than cooking for her husband and children, she took over the kitchen and prepared a meal for 75 members of the church.</p><p>The success of that night inspired her. She attended night classes for six months, earned her ServSafe chef's certification and started working as the full-time chef for the Community Church of Vero Beach.</p><p>Her new career path eventually lead her back to Gainesville— where her life in the U.S. first started.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa4-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa talks with the other chefs at Camp Kulaqua in High Springs, Florida, where she typically works when she's not cooking at Tri-Delta.

Trinity United Methodist Church responded first. After working there for two months, she got a call from the Tri-Delta sorority. They asked if she was interested in becoming their new head chef. Without even knowing what a sorority was at the time, Concessa immediately said yes.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328247278&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tri-Delta sorority sisters and bus boys share love for their "Gainesville Mom."</figcaption></figure><p>Now, she cooks for nearly 200 girls everyday. But she does much more than just cook for them. Considered their “Gainesville Mom” by some, Concessa comforts them, laughs with them and guides them.</p><p>“Whenever we have problems, she’s obviously like one of those therapist-type people, like a hairdresser, you go and talk to her and load all your problems on her,” UF graduate and Tri-Delt sister Chandler Cartwright said. “She’s really good about listening.”</p><p>With her children spread out across Florida and her family more than 1,000 miles away, Concessa has never felt more at home.</p><p>When her sorority girls leave for home over the summer, Concessa looks for part-time work,   as the Tri-Delta house sits empty. This summer she took a temporary cooking job at the Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Maine.</p><p>When she arrived, she was assigned a cabin. Above the green door frame, two words hung on a plaque:</p><p>“Without Limits.”</p><p>“Pretty fitting,” she said. “Don’t you think?”</p>

He is a composer. He is a stage director and designer, and, most importantly, he is a teacher. Mercer joined the Hippodrome Theatre in the spring, in the heart of downtown Gainesville.</p><p>Mercer turned his life around, learning from his past mistakes. He is a role model to anyone who has hit rock bottom.</p><p>"I’m so blessed to have such a fascinating and fun life,” Mercer said. “I may only be 57, but in this short time I’ve been here, I have lived, loved and suffered more than most.

As hard as Mercer tried, he could not remember the cake, balloons, the people or the amount of drinks he had at the party. He felt humiliated, and realized his drinking had gotten out of hand. He needed to make a decision.</p><p>“While sitting on a park bench in Atlanta, I knew I had to choose. I had the option to keep drinking and die, or to sober up and live,” Mercer said.</p><p>Mercer decided to “flip the switch” and stop drinking — cold turkey. He has been sober ever since.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I won’t call it a weakness, because that weakness made me who I am, and gave me the strength and the toolbox that very few others have," he said. "Once you’ve wrestled enough demons, you realize you’re a good demon wrestler.

He never took an acting class, but learned how to act and teach through his own life experiences.</p><p>While a young actor in the ‘80s, Mercer operated as professional escort and sex worker in Atlanta.</p><p>“In that business you have to learn what they want,” Mercer said. “You become that, quickly, and survive it.”</p><p>He was the “star boy” and ran the office. He hired, fired and trained all of “the boys.” Mercer was sent on jobs that were a “suspected bust,” set up by police, because he had the best instincts to assess the situation.

His ability to recognize and take advantage of these "pulls" as opportunities is what makes him intuitive, creative and successful.</p><p>Less Than Jake has released more than 300 albums and songs, created merchandise from chapstick to ice scrapers and stepped on six continents, some of them twice. In the early ‘90s, they were just a group of college students, booking their own shows and traveling to nearby cities and states in a borrowed industrial paint van.</p><p>They would utilize breaks from school to travel while they were attending classes.</p><p>Fiorello remembers using this time on the road to write titles of songs, lyrics and ideas to explore. Generally, he used napkins or any other small scraps of papers and then tucked them into his socks so he wouldn’t lose them.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>At the end of the night I’d be some weird guy taking off his shoes," he said. "And there would be little bits of paper everywhere.

So we are less than Jake.
          </p></blockquote><p>Demakes remembers hanging up thinking that it was the “the stupidest thing in the world.”</p><p>Less Than Jake eventually signed with Capitol Records in 1996. Bigger doors were opening, allowing them to tour places like Europe and Japan.</p><p>Fiorello was 25 and six months into his first job as a teacher, but he quit.</p><p>"Sometimes you have to let moments pull you."</p><p>“You can’t go back and get it. If you sort of feel that gravitational pull forward, you have to recognize that it is happening, and then you have to let it happen," he said.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>The band’s influence was so prominent that Fiorello’s wife, Darcy Dugan, got a Less Than Jake tattoo on her back as a teenager after attending one of the band’s shows in Gainesville.</p><p>The two wouldn’t meet for another year.</p><p>She became a fan during her freshman year in high school but, by the time she turned 19, she was ready to part with the extensive collection of vinyls and merchandise she had gathered over the years.

The same “pull” that brought Fiorello to Gainesville and made him quit his teaching job was happening again.</p><p>“As soon as we met, I knew it was one of those things. There was that magnetism.

Travieso, 30, is also an internationally recognized painter who was born in Havana, but he moved to New York at a young age.</p><p>Their similarities inspired Vallejo, who is on the advisory committee for Bulla Cubana, to pair the two for a mural project.</p><p>"I wanted to prove that culture is a uniting force," Vallejo said. "Same generation — one living in Cuba, one living outside."</p><p>Vallejo said the two artists became dear friends, like brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Batista believes Cuba has more to offer than a history lesson.</p><p>He wants to put Gainesville on the map as a mecca of Cuban art and culture. </p><p>“And this is only the beginning,” Batista says with the urgency of someone trying to make up for lost time.</p><p>For the people who struggled and still struggle, “art and culture was like their lollipop,” Batista says. “This is what they lived for.”</p>

Blood-red carnations, yellow daisies and rose buds in various purples, pinks and blues. A flower for every occasion.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	Melina leans in to study herself in her vanity mirror while she fastens a barrette of violet lilies into her hair. The lilies are the perfect shade, as they match the purple, floral knee-length dress that she is currently wearing. This fashion statement isn’t a mere coincidence. Every dress in Melina’s closet has a twin, a flower that goes just right.</p><blockquote class="right"><p>“These flowers have become a part of my identity,” Melina said. “It’s gotten to the point to where, if I don’t have them on, people notice.”
          </p></blockquote><p>For anyone else, a flower clip is merely an accessory, a stemless plastic flower, but for Melina it’s so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>For her, as a transgender woman, it’s about living in the world as her true, genuine self.</p><p>When Melina first became aware that an abundance of flowers grew wild near her Newberry home, she saw an opportunity that she couldn’t resist. She had to put them to use.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MVI_0507-10.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina greets one of her friends, Blake Pfirrmann, before joining the crowd to march at Gainesville's Equality March for Unity and Pride on June 11.

Melina realized timing was not on her side, a feeling she’s constantly battled throughout her life. </p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Melina has been through the coming out process twice. The first time, in 2007, in California, she struggled to find a safe way to transition. She lacked support, information and resources.</p><p>Feeling defeated, Melina had just about given up on the idea of living in the world authentically, but she persisted.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331769625&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In March of 2016, Melina came out a second time. While many friends and family were quick to accept Melina, others took longer to accept her identity. As time went on, her family and friends gradually came around. A vase of flowers sits in the center of Melina’s living room table, flowers her parents sent her for Mother’s Day.</p><p>At 39, she’s lived her life as Melina for only one year. She has a lot of time to make up.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 5 years old, she would play dress-up with her older sister. She would try on her sister’s clothes, feel the fabric against her skin and feel alive. Even at that young age, she knew she was different, but she lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	“This feeling of wanting to be more feminine and female persisted in more subtle ways after that,” Melina said.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I can remember in second grade, in particular, really wishing I could just be like the other girls.
          </p></blockquote><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"></pdir="ltr"></p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 9, she would steal her sister’s clothes and wear them under her “boy clothes” to school. Her boy clothes were like a suit of armor, another layer hiding who she really was from the world. Once again, she buried those feelings and lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>During her freshman year in high school, there was a day called 'Switch Day,' when everyone came to school dressed as the opposite gender.</p><p>“Even though I loved the idea, I was way too scared to do it myself,” Melina said. “Probably because I knew how much it meant to me subconsciously.”</p><p>She kept lying to herself.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Melinabefore191.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina shares a picture of herself wearing a viking costume 20 years ago, when she was a part of the Sons of Norway, which is a fraternal organization celebrating those of Norweigan heritage.

A group of her male friends came up to her after school, and asked if she would join them in wearing a skirt in protest. Not realizing what the protest was for, she said yes.</p><p>She returned to school the next day in not only a skirt, but a bra filled with water balloons for breasts, pantyhose and heels. She woke up early before school to meet up with a friend who did her make-up. For Melina, wearing a skirt was just not enough.</p><p>Her last period of the day was P.E., and as she stood in the gymnasium contemplating which changing room she wanted to get undressed in before returning home, a girl Melina had a crush on, approached her.</p><p>Intrigued by Melina wearing female clothing, the girl asked her whether Melina would go through the whole female experience, specifically menstruation and pregnancy.</p><p>	“I very definitely remember answering, ‘Yes, yes I would,’” Melina said. “That was probably the closest I came to admitting I was transgender at the time.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"> Melina’s bedroom is a colorful utopia of femininity, from her walk-in closet packed with dresses, each touched with a certain memory from her transition, to her vanity, where brushes, eyeshadow and lipstick of various shades of red gather.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>“This dress doesn’t fit me unfortunately,” Melina said as she pulled out an olive green dress from the depths of her closet. “I’m a little too thick in the chest.”</p><p>Melina rolls her eyes and lets out a loud, infectious laugh.</p><p>She routinely uses self-deprecating humor to make light of the changes her body is making during her transition. While she’s physically changing, she’ll always be Melina. Her surgery, her transition, does not define who she is.<br></p><blockquote class="center"><p>There’s always such a focus on the surgery,” Melina rolls her eyes again. “You don’t ask anyone when their last mammogram or their last prostate exam was, you know? Why would you ask a Trans person about the surgery? It’s really personal.
          </p></blockquote><p>For Melina, living as herself means for her to be seen, to be heard and to be able to move through society without question. It’s about being truthful to herself and to her body.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MelinaBarratt482.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina alongside her fiancé, El, and her two stepchildren, Ari and Naomi.

A smile spreads across Vivian Filer’s face, the next few words rest on her lips, but she holds them back, like a secret.</p><p>“I love.”</p><p>She’s reciting a poem published rather recently for her taste, but she finds it lovely just the same. “Honey, I Love” by Eloise Greenfield.</p><figure class="right"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/334591385&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Vivian Filer recites "I Love"</figcaption></figure><p>As she borrows Greenfield’s words, her voice softens, the words slide into one another. Filer puts the young southern subject of the poem right in front of her listeners.</p><p>Her voice bounces as she recites all the things this young girl loves. It plays between the sweet sounds of carefree youth, and the aged wisdom of a seasoned storyteller.</p><p>Suddenly, it catches and the smile falls from her lips.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>It’s not so late at night, but I’m still in my bed,” Filer says, her voice quivering through a pout. “Honey, let me tell you, I don’t love to go to sleep
          </p></blockquote><p>Just then her voice brightens and she laughs as she recites the last stanza.</p><p>“But I love. I love a lot of things, and honey, I love you too.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Vivian Filer has always had a big voice. In the early 1950s, her church didn’t have microphones, but her voice filled the chapel. When WRUF radio allowed Lincoln High students to broadcast for 15 minutes to celebrate Black History Week, her teachers picked Filer to go on air.</p><p>With strong encouragement from church leaders and teachers, she learned to love her big voice – and to use it.</p><p>She was never taught to simply recite text, but to really read it, perform it, let the words sing.</p><p>The only trouble with a voice like that is it’s a hard thing to silence. And Filer, as a black woman living in Gainesville, was expected to be quiet.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Vivian-Filer001-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Vivian Filer leaning against her storytelling tree across from the Gainesville Cotton Club.

(Luke Sullivan/WUFT News) </figcaption></figure><p>Her voice, once denied entry to the college classroom, eventually taught nursing there.</p><p>Her voice spoke out against racial injustices and secured basic healthcare for Gainesville’s black community.</p><p>And when her neighborhood still faced unfair zoning laws and institutionalized racism after decades of work, her voice called for change.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Filer moved to Gainesville from Trenton, Florida when she was eight years old. By 14, she took her first job as a maid in another family’s home.</p><p>“It was the only thing offered to black people,” Filer said, “We weren’t going to be clerks in a store.”</p><p>After school, she would walk to the white family’s house to do their dishes, make their dinner and put their kids to bed before finally going home around 9 p.m. She would arrive home, do her chores, and then, finally, start her homework.</p><p>Late at night, after all her work was done, she would steal a few moments before bed to read. Many high school students might see the words of long-dead poets draped across a page in a drab, black-and-white monotone as just another academic obstacle to overcome. Filer was taught to speak those words, to go beyond written text and hear the human sounds, the crescendos and decrescendos, the addictive rhythm of poetry.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivian-Filer-0005.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Family portrait of Vivian Filer (center top) with her parents and three sisters. (Luke Sullivan/WUFT News)"><figcaption>Family portrait of Vivian Filer (center top) with her parents and three sisters. (Luke Sullivan/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>What drew her into poetry was “the warmth of it,” she said, “something that really gives, it comes to you and goes out.”</p><p>Her devotion was matched only by her teachers’. Filer attended a segregated high school, which came with some disadvantages. Lincoln High almost always had second-hand books, falling apart after years of use in white schools. The buildings were mostly without air conditioning, so teachers and students opened windows and used fans to stave off the heavy Florida heat. But one distinct advantage of her situation was exposure to black culture and, especially, black literature.</p><p>The day she spoke on the radio, Filer recited “The Creation” by James Weldon Johnson; the story of Genesis spoken, rather than written.</p><p class="blockquote">“This Great God,” the poem reads, “Like a mammy bending over her baby, / Kneeled down in the dust / Toiling over a lump of clay / Till He shaped it in His own image.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227911064"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After Filer’s high school graduation in 1956, she couldn’t move onto college. The University of Florida didn’t accept black students at the time, and Filer couldn’t afford to live away from home to attend a historically black college. Instead, she began working as a nursing assistant.</p><p>Filer would not be able to attend college for more than ten years, until Santa Fe College opened as an integrated school in 1966.</p><p>Nursing evoked in her many of the same feelings that sparked her passion for poetry. Poems took work to understand and perform, but each one gave her insight into her world. As a nurse, her patients demanded her time and taxed her emotions, but in treating them, she found those same unique insights. She quickly grew to love the work.</p><p>Filer quickly found an important difference between her two passions. Nursing lacked the deep respect for African-American culture Filer cherished. She faced racism often — patients didn’t respect her and sometimes dismissed her entirely in favor of a white nurse.</p><p>And the doctors were no better, she said.</p><p>"If we were there,” she said of herself and her black coworkers, “and there was a white person in view, [a doctor] would go to the white person."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>As the 1950s came to a close, the cultural swell of the Civil Rights Movement poured into Gainesville. Filer heard about the work happening around the country by leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who inspired her to make change happen in her own community.</p><p>She was not the only person in Gainesville fed up with the status quo. A group of white women, mostly wives of University of Florida professors, also pressed for change. These women, barred from teaching at the university because of their gender, founded a group called Gainesville Women for Equal Rights, or GWER.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivan-Filer-0009.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Vivian Filer holds a photo of her family at her college graduation.

(Luke Sullivan/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>Filer chose to work with these women because they met as women united, not as white leaders and black supporters.</p><p>During the Civil Rights movement, Filer participated in at least a dozen marches for both women’s liberation and civil rights. Here, again, she found her voice. She sang black spirituals as she marched, showing the protesters who filled the streets exactly why they were fighting.</p><p>But she was not just an activist — she was also a mom.</p><p>A mom who worked nights, so she would have time during the day to be with her kids. It was this work, the tireless, thankless work, in-between birthday parties and kids’ football games, that made progress possible.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I’m often a minor player in whatever has to be done,” she said. “I just want to be in there doing something.
          </p></blockquote><p>She was almost always doing some project or another outside of her work — and those projects weren’t always minor.</p><p>In the early 1960s, Filer and four other members of GWER began desegregating Gainesville’s healthcare system. They walked into segregated dentist offices and hospitals, and asked for equal treatment.&nbsp;</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328465309&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Despite initial discomfort from the white doctors, the black community gained access to quality healthcare.</p><p>This was an impressive victory for civil rights, but it did not seem so extraordinary to Filer’s two young sons.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I remember having a good experience with the dentist and being treated nicely,” said Craig Filer, the younger of the two. “The whole social significance totally escaped me.
          </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Filer is 79 now. She’s retired, but that doesn’t mean she’s not working. She was instrumental in creating Depot Park as a popular neighborhood gathering place. When it became clear the land was unfit for most other purposes, Filer saw an opportunity to create a park for all residents of Gainesville, from the east and west side.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Vivan-Filer-0006-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Filer stands by the park sigh of Springhill Park in east Gainesville, a park she helped create.

Pegeen Hanrahan, mayor of Gainesville during the planning of Depot Park, deeply valued Filer’s perspective during the project.</p><p>“She brings with her a rich experience of growing up in east Gainesville,” said Hanrahan. “I really got to see her in action a great deal and just got to know her passion and skills.”</p><p>Currently, she is spearheading a project to restore the Gainesville Cotton Club.

With Johnny Poontang as the lead singer they toured France in the late 70s.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.
        </p></blockquote><p>“People used to ask us, why was an American band trying to make it in France,” Blake said. “We would always explain to them, if we are going to go around the block and try to make it as a band, we thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.”</p><p>In retrospect, Blake said that this was a good decision.</p><p>Blake and Johnny formed “The Dead Dog” and they toured Europe for three years.</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-5.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake plays his Gibson 335 guitar, that he has had since he played with his rock-n-roll band, “The Dead Dog,” in France.

Blake performed his opening instrumental piece, and as if on cue, Johnny walked out onto the stage with a look on his face of I’ll explain later.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.
        </p></blockquote><p>“That night we played the best show of our career,” Blake said. “We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.”</p><p>After the show, Johnny explained that he had broken up with Gava, and that he had informed her that he didn't think that the band needed her help getting gigs anymore</p><p>This caused a rupture in the band for a while, Blake said. Without Gava’s help “The Dead Dog” struggled to book more gigs.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331370008&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake talks about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang.</figcaption></figure><p> Now 36 years after “The Dead Dog” toured Europe, Blake reminisces about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang, while he was a student at the University of Virginia.</p><p>“My first encounter with Johnny Poontang was when the University of Virginia was still a very conservative university,” Blake said.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.
        </p></blockquote><p>Johnny and a friend were running for student government under the anarchist party ticket. Their campaign poster was a picture of Johnny and his friend holding a cartoon bomb, like the one that Yosemite Sam sported in the “Looney Toons” cartoon series. With the slogan of, “vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.”</p><p>Johnny didn’t win the election, but he and Blake formed a lifelong friendship and bonded over music.</p><p>In January of 1979, after graduating from the University of Virginia and spending 3 years struggling to make it big in France, Blake, his girlfriend Genevieve and Johnny Poontang all piled into a car heading from Geneva, Switzerland, back to Aix-en-Provence, the band's home base in the south of France, with Johnny at the wheel.</p><p> “We were heading, we thought to the south of France,” Blake said. “But we noticed the smell of mustard in the air, which meant that we were outside the town of Dijon.”</p><p>Instead of driving south toward Aix-en-Provence, Johnny intentionally drove north to the city of Dijon.</p><p> Johnny pulled over at a truck stop on the edge of town and told Blake and Genevieve that he had to return to America to secure more funding for the band. He got out of the car and walked to the nearest truck, knocked on the window and told the driver, “tu va à Paris.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-4.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake with his wife, Genevieve, enjoying an afternoon with friends at One Love Café in Gainesville.

After several months and no sign of Johnny, it became apparent that he was not coming back.</p><p> So, the two packed their bags and moved to Virginia. There Blake put together another band with a local guitar player named Ziggy. “At that point, we played around Charlottesville for about a year, and Genevieve said it’s time to try to make it again,” Blake said.</p><p>The three of them packed their bags and headed to Jamaica. There they lived in the guest quarters at Genevieve’s father’s estate in Montego Bay. To make ends meet they worked at a small deli, named Little John’s Deli, where Blake and Genevieve made sandwiches and Ziggy worked nights washing dishes. Soon Ziggy got cold feet, left the band and returned to his studies at the University of Virginia.</p><p>Shortly after Ziggy’s departure, they discovered that Genevieve was pregnant with the first of their three children, son Gabriel.</p><p>Blake and Genevieve quickly moved to the closest college town, Gainesville, Fl.</p><p>“I’ve always lived in college towns and the greatest thing about college towns is the intergenerational mixture and the greatest level of tolerance that can exist in college towns,” Blake said.</p><p>The two coasted into town on fumes, broke and nearly homeless.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake and his wife Genevieve on their wedding day outside of the Alachua County Courthouse.

        </p></blockquote><p>“I don’t think that anyone sets out to become a bartender,” Blake said. Every time that he steps behind the bar, it is a performance, and to Blake that is what makes bartending a great job.</p><p>Blake has been performing what he calls “The Tom Show” at Lillian’s happy hour since 1983. He serves drinks and creates conversation among regulars, many of whom say that they come to Lillian’s because of Blake.</p><p>Blake is what has kept Wade Hurt coming back for nearly 35 years.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226193215"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake, the happy hour bartender from Lillian's Music Store talks about his 35-year carrier as a bartender.</figcaption></figure><p>Chances are that if you are a regular to Lillian’s happy hour, Blake will greet you by your nickname when you walk through the door.</p><p>Blake says that since “The Tom Show” is based on the people who came into the bar and the character that they possess, the nicknames came naturally.</p><p>“The nicknames are terms of endearment that capture part of who you are in an ironic way, or a humorous way,” Blake said.</p><p>Take “Dr. Dirt” for example. Wayde Hurt, or “Dr. Dirt,” as Blake refers to him, is a retired soil scientist and UF professor from Mississippi. “But, when you are a soil scientist from Mississippi, ‘I am just a professor of dirt’,” Blake says.</p><p>Blake attributes his success at bartending to being able to drawing conversation out of anyone who sits down at the bar.</p><p>Over the past 35 years, Blake says that his greatest satisfaction has been the people that he has served and relationships that he helped form between them.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-7.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake with his two daughters, Scarlett (left) and Jasmine (right), after a performance at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville.
