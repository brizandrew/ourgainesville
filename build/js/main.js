Throughout elementary school, college and even now, the Miles' home came to be a place where friends were welcomed with open arms, but they learned quickly that time spent with Phoebe Miles was unpredictable.</p><p>When Elena Miles was in high school, she remembers her mom calling her outside to race toy sailboats powered by lighting cashews on fire.</p><p>And when her mother came to visit her at Wheaton College, she persuaded her daughter's college friends to participate in a dance illustrating what the sodium pump does to your kidneys.</p><p>“All of a sudden I was dancing around pretending to be sugar entering into a sodium pump while my friend was sodium potassium,” she said. “It was ridiculous, but it was very fun.”</p><p>All of it is quintessential Phoebe Miles.</p><p>“I think it’s in her blood,” Elena Miles said. “The Cade Thing.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_0578.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles sits in the patio of her parents' Gainesville home.

Cade was the leader of the team that invented Gatorade in 1965, the sports drink turned sideline staple and global phenomenon.</p><p>The museum opens to the public in the spring of 2018, but for 12 years, Phoebe Miles has pushed it along from concept to construct. She feels it’s her job – her calling – to tell the story of Gainesville.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>One of my motivating factors and the reason I feel I’m called to do this is I thought it was so spectacular to grow up with a father as an inventor,” she said. “I was exposed to so many things. Every day was kind of exciting.
        </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Cade was a gardener, tending to roses and citrus trees in the backyard, and a musician, playing the violin, while his daughter accompanied him on the piano.</p><p>Cade would shut down parties to recite poems from memory, embarrassing his daughter. As an adult, those memories astound her.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“And he must have had them grouped in his mind according to type of event,” she said. “He had funny poems. He had serious poems. He could quote ‘The Raven’ from memory. And sometimes you would have to listen to that.”</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226794764"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At times, he would load his family into one of his antique Studebakers and drive to a Dipper Dan ice cream shop, where each child was allowed a double dip of ice cream.<br></p><p>He liked to get lost, finding his way back home along country roads.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was a romantic," she said. "So if you were out in the middle of a field in a Studebaker and a lightning storm came, it was just the best. Especially if you got lost."</p><p>Phoebe Miles said Cade was a lifelong Lutheran and often spoke of the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was kind of his guiding philosophy, she said:</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If I can help and I have the means to help, that’s what I need to do.

His parents told him if he could find not only a family to live with, but also parents who would act as his legal guardians for his last year, he could finish out high school in Gainesville.</p><p>That’s where the Cade family came in.</p><p>“During the course of that year is when we fell in love,” Phoebe Miles said.<br></p><p>Richard Miles, a retired foreign service officer, said his wife is enthusiastic about making things happen.</p><p>“Well, she’s very energetic,” he said. “She cares deeply about ideas.”</p><p>In high school, he said, she was voted “Most Likely To Spontaneously Combust,” a joke award of sorts, but also a tribute to the never-ending questions she had that could make teachers crazy.<br></p><p>“Even in high school, you know, if it was just a bunch of high-school kids sitting around, Phoebe would usually be the one that would come up with the idea of what we were going to do that day or what place we should go and so on,” he said. “So her house, when we were growing up in high school, was that house that everyone kind of congregates around, because we knew something would be going on at the Cade’s house.”</p><p>Elena Miles, the youngest of Phoebe and Richard Miles’ three children, said her own childhood home was “the hangout house," where her mother was quick to invite friends into one of her experiments or projects.</p><p>"She’s just so inclusive of everybody and so eager to learn about everybody," she said.<br></p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Phoebe-Miles.jpeg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles shows off a speaker that children will make in classes at the Cade Museum with an electromagnetic coil.

Born in rural St. Lucia in 1969 with very little, she learned to embrace adversity as it came, whether it was moving to a different country or starting over at the age of 44.</p><p>It was these challenges that took her from the small island 1,600 miles south of Florida to a mansion on 8th Ave. in Gainesville.</p><p>“My whole life has just been adapting to different situations and circumstances,” Concessa said. “I know the situation that I’m in is better than where I came from.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Concessa grew up on the poor side of the nine-mile-wide island. Her family owned a banana farm, where she and her four siblings worked when they weren’t at school. Growing up without electricity or running water, they used charcoal and wood for all their cooking.</p><p>As a young girl on the island, she was surrounded by alcoholics in her family and community. Both of her parents routinely had marital affairs and their moral values often contradicted their actions. While her father banned her from running track in high school because he thought the uniforms were too revealing, he failed to protect her from the men who would linger in and around her home. She had no way out until 1986, when she met Kim Bowman.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="A 17-year-old Concessa stands with 27-year-old Kim in 1986.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>Volunteering with the Peace Corps., Kim came to St. Lucia from Gainesville. Concessa and her family worshipped him because he was white. Raised in a predominately black community and country, their only previous knowledge of white people came from the television shows “Dallas” and “Knots Landing.” She and her siblings would watch these shows every week at a friend’s house where there was a TV.</p><p>When the 27-year-old UF Ph.D. student took an interest in Concessa, the community in St. Lucia saw her as the “chosen one.” She faced immense pressure from her family to marry him, as they saw her opportunity to leave as their own path to the American dream.</p><p>Concessa felt like she had no other option.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>At 17, I didn’t know what love was,” she said. “But it was my mom sitting me down on the bed in our home and saying ‘This is what you will do for the family.’ So I felt like I just went along with that plan.
        </p></blockquote><p>That plan brought her to Gainesville in 1987. The Bowmans spent the next 13 years hopping around various Florida cities before settling in Vero Beach, where they would spend the next seven years together. During this time, Concessa and Kim had three children together and joined the Community Church of Vero Beach. It was at church that Concessa would see the end of one chapter of her life and the beginning of another.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Having grown up around abusive, alcoholic men in St. Lucia, Concessa never really knew any different. Her only idea of marriage came from her parents. These views changed when the church appointed her deacon.</p><p>As Concessa met more families in the congregation, she got a glimpse of what a strong marriage looked like. She began to question her own. It reminded her of the relationships she knew growing up.</p><p>She felt trapped.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa10-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa and Kim stand with their children Garrett, Deanna and Karina in front of the Community Church of Vero Beach.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>As she continued to contemplate her marriage, she also developed a passion for running. While she wasn’t very fast and couldn’t run long distances at first, she loved running. It helped her think. And over time, she saw herself get stronger and faster.</p><p>She discovered if she practiced and committed herself to running, she would eventually get better. Concessa applied this same logic to her everyday life.</p><p>“Considering I couldn’t even run for a mile, to see how the body changed and my way of thinking had changed to actually do a 10k or a 5k … I could do that with my life, and apply those same techniques with taking steps to ending my marriage and how I did that was my way of communication with God,” she said. “I call it my therapy, just to escape in that way of thinking for the time that I was running so that I could then come back and apply what I’ve been thinking about to my daily life with my marriage and with everything that I did.”</p><p>She ended her marriage with Kim.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225312548"></iframe><figcaption>Concessa Jean-Marie Bowman shares what she's accomplished through cooking.</figcaption></figure><p>Concessa continued her work at the church, helping organize bible studies and dinners. One night, as the church prepared for a community dinner, their chef didn’t show. When she called him, he told her he was in South Carolina and would not be returning. Thinking this couldn’t be much different than cooking for her husband and children, she took over the kitchen and prepared a meal for 75 members of the church.</p><p>The success of that night inspired her. She attended night classes for six months, earned her ServSafe chef's certification and started working as the full-time chef for the Community Church of Vero Beach.</p><p>Her new career path eventually lead her back to Gainesville— where her life in the U.S. first started.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa4-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa talks with the other chefs at Camp Kulaqua in High Springs, Florida, where she typically works when she's not cooking at Tri-Delta.

Trinity United Methodist Church responded first. After working there for two months, she got a call from the Tri-Delta sorority. They asked if she was interested in becoming their new head chef. Without even knowing what a sorority was at the time, Concessa immediately said yes.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328247278&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tri-Delta sorority sisters and bus boys share love for their "Gainesville Mom."</figcaption></figure><p>Now, she cooks for nearly 200 girls everyday. But she does much more than just cook for them. Considered their “Gainesville Mom” by some, Concessa comforts them, laughs with them and guides them.</p><p>“Whenever we have problems, she’s obviously like one of those therapist-type people, like a hairdresser, you go and talk to her and load all your problems on her,” UF graduate and Tri-Delt sister Chandler Cartwright said. “She’s really good about listening.”</p><p>With her children spread out across Florida and her family more than 1,000 miles away, Concessa has never felt more at home.</p><p>When her sorority girls leave for home over the summer, Concessa looks for part-time work,   as the Tri-Delta house sits empty. This summer she took a temporary cooking job at the Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Maine.</p><p>When she arrived, she was assigned a cabin. Above the green door frame, two words hung on a plaque:</p><p>“Without Limits.”</p><p>“Pretty fitting,” she said. “Don’t you think?”</p>

He is a composer. He is a stage director and designer, and, most importantly, he is a teacher. Mercer joined the Hippodrome Theatre in the spring, in the heart of downtown Gainesville.</p><p>Mercer turned his life around, learning from his past mistakes. He is a role model to anyone who has hit rock bottom.</p><p>"I’m so blessed to have such a fascinating and fun life,” Mercer said. “I may only be 57, but in this short time I’ve been here, I have lived, loved and suffered more than most.

As hard as Mercer tried, he could not remember the cake, balloons, the people or the amount of drinks he had at the party. He felt humiliated, and realized his drinking had gotten out of hand. He needed to make a decision.</p><p>“While sitting on a park bench in Atlanta, I knew I had to choose. I had the option to keep drinking and die, or to sober up and live,” Mercer said.</p><p>Mercer decided to “flip the switch” and stop drinking — cold turkey. He has been sober ever since.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I won’t call it a weakness, because that weakness made me who I am, and gave me the strength and the toolbox that very few others have," he said. "Once you’ve wrestled enough demons, you realize you’re a good demon wrestler.

He never took an acting class, but learned how to act and teach through his own life experiences.</p><p>While a young actor in the ‘80s, Mercer operated as professional escort and sex worker in Atlanta.</p><p>“In that business you have to learn what they want,” Mercer said. “You become that, quickly, and survive it.”</p><p>He was the “star boy” and ran the office. He hired, fired and trained all of “the boys.” Mercer was sent on jobs that were a “suspected bust,” set up by police, because he had the best instincts to assess the situation.

His ability to recognize and take advantage of these "pulls" as opportunities is what makes him intuitive, creative and successful.</p><p>Less Than Jake has released more than 300 albums and songs, created merchandise from chapstick to ice scrapers and stepped on six continents, some of them twice. In the early ‘90s, they were just a group of college students, booking their own shows and traveling to nearby cities and states in a borrowed industrial paint van.</p><p>They would utilize breaks from school to travel while they were attending classes.</p><p>Fiorello remembers using this time on the road to write titles of songs, lyrics and ideas to explore. Generally, he used napkins or any other small scraps of papers and then tucked them into his socks so he wouldn’t lose them.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>At the end of the night I’d be some weird guy taking off his shoes," he said. "And there would be little bits of paper everywhere.

So we are less than Jake.
          </p></blockquote><p>Demakes remembers hanging up thinking that it was the “the stupidest thing in the world.”</p><p>Less Than Jake eventually signed with Capitol Records in 1996. Bigger doors were opening, allowing them to tour places like Europe and Japan.</p><p>Fiorello was 25 and six months into his first job as a teacher, but he quit.</p><p>"Sometimes you have to let moments pull you."</p><p>“You can’t go back and get it. If you sort of feel that gravitational pull forward, you have to recognize that it is happening, and then you have to let it happen," he said.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>The band’s influence was so prominent that Fiorello’s wife, Darcy Dugan, got a Less Than Jake tattoo on her back as a teenager after attending one of the band’s shows in Gainesville.</p><p>The two wouldn’t meet for another year.</p><p>She became a fan during her freshman year in high school but, by the time she turned 19, she was ready to part with the extensive collection of vinyls and merchandise she had gathered over the years.

The same “pull” that brought Fiorello to Gainesville and made him quit his teaching job was happening again.</p><p>“As soon as we met, I knew it was one of those things. There was that magnetism.

Travieso, 30, is also an internationally recognized painter who was born in Havana, but he moved to New York at a young age.</p><p>Their similarities inspired Vallejo, who is on the advisory committee for Bulla Cubana, to pair the two for a mural project.</p><p>"I wanted to prove that culture is a uniting force," Vallejo said. "Same generation — one living in Cuba, one living outside."</p><p>Vallejo said the two artists became dear friends, like brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Batista believes Cuba has more to offer than a history lesson.</p><p>He wants to put Gainesville on the map as a mecca of Cuban art and culture. </p><p>“And this is only the beginning,” Batista says with the urgency of someone trying to make up for lost time.</p><p>For the people who struggled and still struggle, “art and culture was like their lollipop,” Batista says. “This is what they lived for.”</p>

Blood-red carnations, yellow daisies and rose buds in various purples, pinks and blues. A flower for every occasion.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	Melina leans in to study herself in her vanity mirror while she fastens a barrette of violet lilies into her hair. The lilies are the perfect shade, as they match the purple, floral knee-length dress that she is currently wearing. This fashion statement isn’t a mere coincidence. Every dress in Melina’s closet has a twin, a flower that goes just right.</p><blockquote class="right"><p>“These flowers have become a part of my identity,” Melina said. “It’s gotten to the point to where, if I don’t have them on, people notice.”
          </p></blockquote><p>For anyone else, a flower clip is merely an accessory, a stemless plastic flower, but for Melina it’s so much more.&nbsp;</p><p>For her, as a transgender woman, it’s about living in the world as her true, genuine self.</p><p>When Melina first became aware that an abundance of flowers grew wild near her Newberry home, she saw an opportunity that she couldn’t resist. She had to put them to use.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MVI_0507-10.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina greets one of her friends, Blake Pfirrmann, before joining the crowd to march at Gainesville's Equality March for Unity and Pride on June 11.

Melina realized timing was not on her side, a feeling she’s constantly battled throughout her life. </p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Melina has been through the coming out process twice. The first time, in 2007, in California, she struggled to find a safe way to transition. She lacked support, information and resources.</p><p>Feeling defeated, Melina had just about given up on the idea of living in the world authentically, but she persisted.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331769625&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>In March of 2016, Melina came out a second time. While many friends and family were quick to accept Melina, others took longer to accept her identity. As time went on, her family and friends gradually came around. A vase of flowers sits in the center of Melina’s living room table, flowers her parents sent her for Mother’s Day.</p><p>At 39, she’s lived her life as Melina for only one year. She has a lot of time to make up.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 5 years old, she would play dress-up with her older sister. She would try on her sister’s clothes, feel the fabric against her skin and feel alive. Even at that young age, she knew she was different, but she lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	“This feeling of wanting to be more feminine and female persisted in more subtle ways after that,” Melina said.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I can remember in second grade, in particular, really wishing I could just be like the other girls.
          </p></blockquote><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"></pdir="ltr"></p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 9, she would steal her sister’s clothes and wear them under her “boy clothes” to school. Her boy clothes were like a suit of armor, another layer hiding who she really was from the world. Once again, she buried those feelings and lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>During her freshman year in high school, there was a day called 'Switch Day,' when everyone came to school dressed as the opposite gender.</p><p>“Even though I loved the idea, I was way too scared to do it myself,” Melina said. “Probably because I knew how much it meant to me subconsciously.”</p><p>She kept lying to herself.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Melinabefore191.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina shares a picture of herself wearing a viking costume 20 years ago, when she was a part of the Sons of Norway, which is a fraternal organization celebrating those of Norweigan heritage.

(Courtesy of Melina Barratt)</figcaption></figure><p>The next year, one of Melina’s male friends got in trouble for wearing a kilt to school. A group of her male friends came up to her after school, and asked if she would join them in wearing a skirt in protest. Not realizing what the protest was for, she said yes.</p><p>She returned to school the next day in not only a skirt, but a bra filled with water balloons for breasts, pantyhose and heels. She woke up early before school to meet up with a friend who did her make-up. For Melina, wearing a skirt was just not enough.</p><p>Her last period of the day was P.E., and as she stood in the gymnasium contemplating which changing room she wanted to get undressed in before returning home, a girl Melina had a crush on, approached her.</p><p>Intrigued by Melina wearing female clothing, the girl asked her whether Melina would go through the whole female experience, specifically menstruation and pregnancy.</p><p>	“I very definitely remember answering, ‘Yes, yes I would,’” Melina said. “That was probably the closest I came to admitting I was transgender at the time.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"> Melina’s bedroom is a colorful utopia of femininity, from her walk-in closet packed with dresses, each touched with a certain memory from her transition, to her vanity, where brushes, eyeshadow and lipstick of various shades of red gather.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>“This dress doesn’t fit me unfortunately,” Melina said as she pulled out an olive green dress from the depths of her closet. “I’m a little too thick in the chest.”</p><p>Melina rolls her eyes and lets out a loud, infectious laugh.</p><p>She routinely uses self-deprecating humor to make light of the changes her body is making during her transition. While she’s physically changing, she’ll always be Melina. Her surgery, her transition, does not define who she is.<br></p><blockquote class="center"><p>There’s always such a focus on the surgery,” Melina rolls her eyes again. “You don’t ask anyone when their last mammogram or their last prostate exam was, you know? Why would you ask a Trans person about the surgery? It’s really personal.
          </p></blockquote><p>For Melina, living as herself means for her to be seen, to be heard and to be able to move through society without question. It’s about being truthful to herself and to her body.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MelinaBarratt482.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina alongside her fiancé, El, and her two stepchildren, Ari and Naomi.

El swipes through pictures on their phone.</p><p>“Hey sweetie, what do you think of this?”</p><p>El leans over to show Melina a set of binders on Etsy that they’ve been meaning to buy. The binders are sparkly pink, but come in an assortment of colors including various shades of skin tone.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/IMG_0524.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina and El share an intimate moment during Gainesville's Equality March for Unity and Pride on June 11.

The tightness of the binding can have negative side effects, from back pain to postural issues, but for El, it’s worth it. That small amount of fabric is enough to make El feel comfortable in their skin, a feeling Melina can empathize with.</p><p><pclass="msonormal">Melina looks down at her living room carpet and frowns. Dog hair. She has a friend coming to visit the next week, and was hoping to have the place clean.
          </pclass="msonormal"></p><p>“I haven’t officially invited her yet,” El admits from the couch.</p><p>“Get to it, woman not woman,” Melina smirks, her body shaking as she audibly holds back a fit of laughter.</p><p>El sarcastically groans and Melina cackles. She got the reaction she was looking for.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226806922"></iframe><figcaption>Melina shares her experience as a transgender woman living in North Central Florida.
