      <h2>For Phoebe Miles, Gainesville's story of innovation starts with her father</h2><p>"You never really know what’s going to happen when you go to Mrs. Miles’ house."</p><p>Growing up, when Elena Miles’ friends would come over, they knew to expect the unexpected. Throughout elementary school, college and even now, the Miles' home came to be a place where friends were welcomed with open arms, but they learned quickly that time spent with Elena's mother Phoebe Miles was unpredictable.</p><p>When Elena Miles was in high school, she remembers her mom calling her outside to race toy sailboats powered by lighting cashews on fire.</p><p>And when her mother came to visit her at Wheaton College, she persuaded her daughter's college friends to participate in a dance illustrating what the sodium pump does to your kidneys.</p><p>“All of a sudden I was dancing around pretending to be sugar entering into a sodium pump while my friend was sodium potassium,” she says. “It was ridiculous, but it was very fun.”</p><p>All of it is quintessential Phoebe Miles.</p><p>“I think it’s in her blood,” Elena Miles says. “The Cade Thing.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_0578.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles sits in the patio of her parents' Gainesville home.

(Cecilia Mazanec/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>Phoebe Miles, along with her husband Richard Miles, founded the Cade Museum for Creativity and Invention in 2004 and named it after her father Dr. Robert Cade, who died in 2007. Cade was the leader of the team that invented Gatorade in 1965, the sports drink turned sideline staple and global phenomenon.</p><p>The museum opens to the public in the spring of 2018, but for 12 years, Phoebe Miles has pushed it along from concept to construct. She feels it’s her job — her calling — to tell the story of Gainesville.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>One of my motivating factors and the reason I feel I’m called to do this is I thought it was so spectacular to grow up with a father as an inventor,” she says. “I was exposed to so many things. Every day was kind of exciting.
      </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Cade was a gardener, tending to roses and citrus trees in the backyard, and a musician, playing the violin, while his daughter accompanied him on the piano.</p><p>Cade would shut down parties to recite poems from memory, embarrassing his daughter. As an adult, those memories astound her.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“And he must have had them grouped in his mind according to type of event,” she says. “He had funny poems. He had serious poems. He could quote ‘The Raven’ from memory. And sometimes you would have to listen to that.”</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226794764"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At times, he would load his family into one of his antique Studebakers and drive to a Dipper Dan ice cream shop, where each child was allowed a double dip of ice cream.<br></p><p>He liked to get lost, finding his way back home along country roads.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was a romantic," she says. "So if you were out in the middle of a field in a Studebaker and a lightning storm came, it was just the best. Especially if you got lost."</p><p>Phoebe Miles says Cade was a lifelong Lutheran and often spoke of the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was kind of his guiding philosophy, she says:</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If I can help and I have the means to help, that’s what I need to do.
      </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Phoebe Miles met her husband, Richard, while the two were attending Buchholz High School.

His parents told him if he could find not only a family to live with, but also parents who would act as his legal guardians for his last year, he could finish out high school in Gainesville.</p><p>That’s where the Cade family came in.</p><p>“During the course of that year is when we fell in love,” Phoebe Miles says.<br></p><p>Richard Miles, a retired foreign service officer, said his wife is enthusiastic about making things happen.</p><p>“Well, she’s very energetic,” he says. “She cares deeply about ideas.”</p><p>In high school, he says, she was voted “Most Likely To Spontaneously Combust,” a joke award of sorts, but also a tribute to the never-ending questions she had that could make teachers crazy.<br></p><p>“Even in high school, you know, if it was just a bunch of high-school kids sitting around, Phoebe would usually be the one that would come up with the idea of what we were going to do that day or what place we should go and so on,” he says. “So her house, when we were growing up in high school, was that house that everyone kind of congregates around, because we knew something would be going on at the Cade’s house.”</p><p>Elena Miles, the youngest of Phoebe and Richard Miles’ three children, says her own childhood home was “the hangout house," where her mother was quick to invite friends into one of her experiments or projects.</p><p>"She’s just so inclusive of everybody and so eager to learn about everybody," she says.<br></p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Phoebe-Miles.jpeg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles shows off a speaker that children will make in classes at the Cade Museum with an electromagnetic coil.

Born in rural St. Lucia in 1969 with very little, she learned to embrace adversity as it came, whether it was moving to a different country or starting over at the age of 44.</p><p>It was these challenges that took her from the small island 1,600 miles south of Florida to a mansion on 8th Ave. in Gainesville.</p><p>“My whole life has just been adapting to different situations and circumstances,” Concessa said. “I know the situation that I’m in is better than where I came from.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Concessa grew up on the poor side of the nine-mile-wide island. Her family owned a banana farm, where she and her four siblings worked when they weren’t at school. Growing up without electricity or running water, they used charcoal and wood for all their cooking.</p><p>As a young girl on the island, she was surrounded by alcoholics in her family and community. Both of her parents routinely had marital affairs and their moral values often contradicted their actions. While her father banned her from running track in high school because he thought the uniforms were too revealing, he failed to protect her from the men who would linger in and around her home. She had no way out until 1986, when she met Kim Bowman.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="A 17-year-old Concessa stands with 27-year-old Kim in 1986.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>Volunteering with the Peace Corps., Kim came to St. Lucia from Gainesville. Concessa and her family worshipped him because he was white. Raised in a predominately black community and country, their only previous knowledge of white people came from the television shows “Dallas” and “Knots Landing.” She and her siblings would watch these shows every week at a friend’s house where there was a TV.</p><p>When the 27-year-old UF Ph.D. student took an interest in Concessa, the community in St. Lucia saw her as the “chosen one.” She faced immense pressure from her family to marry him, as they saw her opportunity to leave as their own path to the American dream.</p><p>Concessa felt like she had no other option.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>At 17, I didn’t know what love was,” she said. “But it was my mom sitting me down on the bed in our home and saying ‘This is what you will do for the family.’ So I felt like I just went along with that plan.
        </p></blockquote><p>That plan brought her to Gainesville in 1987. The Bowmans spent the next 13 years hopping around various Florida cities before settling in Vero Beach, where they would spend the next seven years together. During this time, Concessa and Kim had three children together and joined the Community Church of Vero Beach. It was at church that Concessa would see the end of one chapter of her life and the beginning of another.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Having grown up around abusive, alcoholic men in St. Lucia, Concessa never really knew any different. Her only idea of marriage came from her parents. These views changed when the church appointed her deacon.</p><p>As Concessa met more families in the congregation, she got a glimpse of what a strong marriage looked like. She began to question her own. It reminded her of the relationships she knew growing up.</p><p>She felt trapped.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa10-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa and Kim stand with their children Garrett, Deanna and Karina in front of the Community Church of Vero Beach.

(Courtesy of Concessa Bowman)</figcaption></figure><p>As she continued to contemplate her marriage, she also developed a passion for running. While she wasn’t very fast and couldn’t run long distances at first, she loved running. It helped her think. And over time, she saw herself get stronger and faster.</p><p>She discovered if she practiced and committed herself to running, she would eventually get better. Concessa applied this same logic to her everyday life.</p><p>“Considering I couldn’t even run for a mile, to see how the body changed and my way of thinking had changed to actually do a 10k or a 5k … I could do that with my life, and apply those same techniques with taking steps to ending my marriage and how I did that was my way of communication with God,” she said. “I call it my therapy, just to escape in that way of thinking for the time that I was running so that I could then come back and apply what I’ve been thinking about to my daily life with my marriage and with everything that I did.”</p><p>She ended her marriage with Kim.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225312548"></iframe><figcaption>Concessa Jean-Marie Bowman shares what she's accomplished through cooking.</figcaption></figure><p>Concessa continued her work at the church, helping organize bible studies and dinners. One night, as the church prepared for a community dinner, their chef didn’t show. When she called him, he told her he was in South Carolina and would not be returning. Thinking this couldn’t be much different than cooking for her husband and children, she took over the kitchen and prepared a meal for 75 members of the church.</p><p>The success of that night inspired her. She attended night classes for six months, earned her ServSafe chef's certification and started working as the full-time chef for the Community Church of Vero Beach.</p><p>Her new career path eventually lead her back to Gainesville— where her life in the U.S. first started.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Concessa4-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Concessa talks with the other chefs at Camp Kulaqua in High Springs, Florida, where she typically works when she's not cooking at Tri-Delta.

Trinity United Methodist Church responded first. After working there for two months, she got a call from the Tri-Delta sorority. They asked if she was interested in becoming their new head chef. Without even knowing what a sorority was at the time, Concessa immediately said yes.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/328247278&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tri-Delta sorority sisters and bus boys share love for their "Gainesville Mom."</figcaption></figure><p>Now, she cooks for nearly 200 girls everyday.

This summer she took a temporary cooking job at the Tripp Lake Camp in Poland, Maine.</p><p>When she arrived, she was assigned a cabin.

Mercer ended up getting the part — instead of his friend —&nbsp;and has been acting ever since.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Although he was attracted to the limelight, Mercer's childhood was not always glamorous.</p><p>He comes from an abusive household and knew the Alcoholics Anonymous family well. Mercer’s father, Rodney Mercer, was an alcoholic. His mother, Sylvia Mercer, was an "enabler." Holidays weren't always cheerful, but instead were a time filled with drinking, violence and frequent beatings, Mercer says.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330955103&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Mercer's grandparents, Robert and Doris Yonge, provided the stability for him and his siblings. They always had food on the table and taught their grandchildren manners and unconditional acceptance. Mercer spent a majority of his youth with his grandparents and their friends because that is where he felt most comfortable.</p><p>"We grew up in severe isolation, it was just the three of us,” his sister Vicki Mercer says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If it wasn’t for our grandparents, there’s no telling how the three of us would have turned out.</p></blockquote><p>When Mercer was 11 years old, he visited maximum-security prisons with his parents and his siblings to give speeches and tell prisoners about opportunities through AA.</p><p>Often, when standing in front of the microphone, he felt unworthy, unprepared and alone. He spoke to a sea of scowling faces about the impact AA had on his life.</p><p>But it wasn't enough.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>At age 16, &nbsp;he played the piano in the front bay window of Peter Dinkles, a bar built in the 1890s in Ocala. As he played, older men tipped him with drinks. He started to enjoy the bourbon and Manhattans.&nbsp;</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Mercer20.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Mercer plays the piano at The Hippodrome Theatre.

(Sydney Brodie / WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>In 1980, when he was 30, he was drawn to the mirrored disco balls and dance halls of Atlanta, Georgia. Mercer moved there for the opportunity to work in film, its open gay community and the disco clubs.</p><p>Three years later, Mercer moved to New York City for a fresh start, but soon he found himself on the streets after his boyfriend kicked him out without warning.</p><p>He spent several days sleeping on park benches in Brooklyn, cold and alone, before moving back to Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>Friends and family threw Mercer a birthday party in Atlanta in February 1987. As hard as Mercer tried, he could not remember the cake, balloons, the people or the amount of drinks he had at the party. He felt humiliated, and realized his drinking had gotten out of hand. He needed to make a decision.</p><p>“While sitting on a park bench in Atlanta, I knew I had to choose. I had the option to keep drinking and die, or to sober up and live,” Mercer says.</p><p>Mercer decided to “flip the switch” and stop drinking — cold turkey. He has been sober ever since.</p><p>"I won’t call it a weakness, because that weakness made me who I am, and gave me the strength and the toolbox that very few others have," he says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Once you’ve wrestled enough demons, you realize you’re a good demon wrestler.</p></blockquote><p>Mercer attributes his mistakes to what makes him such a great actor today. He never took an acting class, but learned how to act and teach through his own life experiences.</p><p>While a young actor in the '80s, Mercer operated as professional escort and sex worker in Atlanta.</p><p>“In that business you have to learn what they want,” Mercer says. “You become that, quickly, and survive it.”</p><p>He was the “star boy” and ran the office. He hired, fired and trained all of “the boys.” Mercer was sent on jobs that were a “suspected bust,” set up by police because he had the best instincts to assess the situation. He knew how to conduct himself in an expensive restaurant, formal function or any other delicate situations.</p><figure class="full video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/225129577"></iframe><figcaption>Mercer speaks about his experience with The Hippodrome Theatre. (Sydney Brodie / WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>But it all came to an end on Father’s Day in 1987 when he took a call to a "less than glamorous" hotel in Atlanta.&nbsp;</p><p>He was greeted by a handsome young man who was polite and talkative. While waiting for the man to make the first move — the escort is not allowed to make the first physical or verbal move — Mercer slipped up and uttered an "innocuous euphuism."</p><p>The adjoining room door swung open and he was cuffed in a matter of seconds.</p><p>“This is my scarlet letter that will never go away,” Mercer says. “I live in its shadow in full honesty, humility and hope for others.”</p><p>Mercer's sex-worker career ended that day in a dark and dingy hotel room, but he carries the lessons with him on stage and into the classroom.</p><p>“Life is too short and miserable to exist without a dream. I'm here. Right here, right now. Might as well make the best of it,” Mercer says.</p>

His ability to recognize and take advantage of these "pulls" as opportunities is what makes him intuitive, creative and successful.</p><p>Less Than Jake has released more than 300 albums and songs, created merchandise from chapstick to ice scrapers and stepped on six continents, some of them twice.

As a child he witnessed firsthand the violence and political instability that continues to plague the communist country. One neighbor was hanged, suspected a “sympathizer” to the revolution. Another was killed by a stray bullet.</p><p>For his own safety, his parents sent him to live with his grandparents on the outskirts of Tampa in 1961.</p><p>His father, Wilfredo, was not allowed to leave the country. His education, which included a master’s degree in soil science from the University of Florida, made him too valuable in the eyes of the Cuban government. Batista’s mother, Alfonsina, stayed behind to take care of him as he was suffering from Parkinson’s disease.<br></p><p>As Batista’s father’s condition worsened, his mother persuaded the government he was no longer an asset to the country.

Poverty stricken, no food, no meds, cars that had been running from 1957, buildings that had lacked paint. It was just a free canvas to photograph every imaginable, conceivable thing you could possibly think of. And I think that’s the alluring thing about Cuba, it literally has stood still."</p><p>Among the degraded infrastructure and automotive relics, Batista noticed an ingenuinity in the Cuban people. He marveled at how they rigged goods to survive.</p><p>He watched a man use a bicycle tire and hose to form an adapter for a power washer. Another turned a transformer into a welder. When a gas station didn't have electricity, Cubans connected the pump to a bicycle chain and manually siphoned it to the car.</p><p>That cars run at all in Cuba is a testament to the engineering prowess of these people.</p><p><pstyle="margin: 0px;="" font-size:="" 11px;="" line-height:="" normal;="" font-family:="" helvetica;="" -webkit-text-stroke-width:="" initial;="" -webkit-text-stroke-color:="" rgb(0,="" 0,="" 0);"="">“1958 and 1959 were the last of the cars that were brought into Cuba, so you see a lot of those throughout the country," Batista says. "Many nowadays will have a Spanish transmission or a Russian diesel engine. The cars have been totally rigged because the people couldn’t get American parts.”<br></pstyle="margin:></p><p>Batista set to work capturing as much as he could of the people and their creations, but he knew one trip would not be enough to document everything.</p><p>He has visited the island more than 15 times since 1996.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Batista owned a photography studio in downtown Gainesville beginning in 1974, but he closed its doors in 2013 and turned his focus to bringing Cuban culture back to share with the city he has called home for nearly 50 years.</p><p>First in documentaries; then with people.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/329009379&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>He brought Cuban artists — dancers, painters, singers, writers, filmmakers — to share with the community.</p><p>He created a festival, “Bulla Cubana,” to showcase Cuba’s diverse talent.</p><p>“Bulla” meaning an uproarious noise, which Batista endearingly attributes to the Cuban people.</p><p>The Bulla Cubana artists performed for the first time in January, kicking off three months of festivities scattered around Gainesville that filled galleries at the Harn Museum and permeated the streets of downtown with the sounds of conga drums and smells of moros y cristianos and tostones (rice and beans and deep-fried plantain slices).</p><p>Seasoned immigrants like Raquel Vallejo told their stories of love, loss and reconnection with Cuba. Many left with nothing during the tumultuous 1960s and were forced to restart in America.

"Same generation — one living in Cuba, one living outside."</p><p>Vallejo says the two artists became dear friends, like brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Batista believes Cuba has more to offer than a history lesson.</p><p>He wants to put Gainesville on the map as a mecca of Cuban art and culture. </p><p>“And this is only the beginning,” Batista says with the urgency of someone trying to make up for lost time.</p><p>For the people who struggled and still struggle, “art and culture was like their lollipop,” Batista says. “This is what they lived for.”</p>

A flower for every occasion.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	Melina leans in to study herself in her vanity mirror while she fastens a barrette of violet lilies into her hair. The lilies are the perfect shade, as they match the purple, floral knee-length dress that she is currently wearing. This fashion statement isn’t a mere coincidence.

While many friends and family were quick to accept Melina, others took longer to accept her identity. As time went on, her family and friends gradually came around. A vase of flowers sits in the center of Melina’s living room table, flowers her parents sent her for Mother’s Day.</p><p>At 39, she’s lived her life as Melina for only one year. She has a lot of time to make up.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 5 years old, she would play dress-up with her older sister. She would try on her sister’s clothes, feel the fabric against her skin and feel alive. Even at that young age, she knew she was different, but she lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>	“This feeling of wanting to be more feminine and female persisted in more subtle ways after that,” Melina says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>I can remember in second grade, in particular, really wishing I could just be like the other girls.</p></blockquote><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"></pdir="ltr"></p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;">When Melina was 9, she would steal her sister’s clothes and wear them under her “boy clothes” to school. Her boy clothes were like a suit of armor, another layer hiding who she really was from the world. Once again, she buried those feelings and lied to herself.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>During her freshman year in high school, there was a day called 'Switch Day,' when everyone came to school dressed as the opposite gender.</p><p>“Even though I loved the idea, I was way too scared to do it myself,” Melina says. “Probably because I knew how much it meant to me subconsciously.”</p><p>She kept lying to herself.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Melinabefore191.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina shares a picture of herself wearing a Viking costume 20 years ago, when she was a part of the Sons of Norway, which is a fraternal organization celebrating those of Norwegian heritage.

A group of her male friends came up to her after school, and asked if she would join them in wearing a skirt in protest. Not realizing what the protest was for, she said yes.</p><p>She returned to school the next day in not only a skirt, but a bra filled with water balloons for breasts, pantyhose and heels. She woke up early before school to meet up with a friend who did her make-up. For Melina, wearing a skirt was just not enough.</p><p>Her last period of the day was P.E., and as she stood in the gymnasium contemplating which changing room she wanted to get undressed in before returning home, a girl Melina had a crush on, approached her.</p><p>Intrigued by Melina wearing female clothing, the girl asked her whether Melina would go through the whole female experience, specifically menstruation and pregnancy.</p><p>	“I very definitely remember answering, ‘Yes, yes I would,’” Melina says. “That was probably the closest I came to admitting I was transgender at the time.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.295;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;text-indent: 36pt;"> Melina’s bedroom is a colorful utopia of femininity, from her walk-in closet packed with dresses, each touched with a certain memory from her transition, to her vanity, where brushes, eyeshadow and lipstick of various shades of red gather.</pdir="ltr"></p><p>“This dress doesn’t fit me unfortunately,” Melina says as she pulled out an olive green dress from the depths of her closet. “I’m a little too thick in the chest.”</p><p>Melina rolls her eyes and lets out a loud, infectious laugh.</p><p>She routinely uses self-deprecating humor to make light of the changes her body is making during her transition. While she’s physically changing, she’ll always be Melina. Her surgery, her transition, does not define who she is.<br></p><blockquote class="center"><p>There’s always such a focus on the surgery,” Melina rolls her eyes again. “You don’t ask anyone when their last mammogram or their last prostate exam was, you know? Why would you ask a Trans person about the surgery? It’s really personal.</p></blockquote><p>For Melina, living as herself means for her to be seen, to be heard and to be able to move through society without question. It’s about being truthful to herself and to her body.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/MelinaBarratt482.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Melina alongside her fiancé, El, and her two stepchildren, Ari and Naomi.

By 14, she took her first job as a maid in another family’s home.</p><p>“It was the only thing offered to black people,” Filer says. “We weren’t going to be clerks in a store.”</p><p>After school, she would walk to the white family’s house to do their dishes, make their dinner and put their kids to bed before finally going home around 9 p.m. She would arrive home, do her chores, and then, finally, start her homework.</p><p>Late at night, after all her work was done, she would steal a few moments before bed to read. Many high school students might see the words of long-dead poets draped across a page in a drab, black-and-white monotone as just another academic obstacle to overcome. Filer was taught to speak those words, to go beyond written text and hear the human sounds, the crescendos and decrescendos, the addictive rhythm of poetry.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivian-Filer-0005.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Family portrait of Vivian Filer (center top) with her parents and three sisters.

(Luke Sullivan/WUFT News)</figcaption></figure><p>What drew her into poetry was “the warmth of it,” she says, “something that really gives, it comes to you and goes out.”</p><p>Her devotion was matched only by her teachers’. Filer attended a segregated high school, which came with some disadvantages. Lincoln High almost always had second-hand books, falling apart after years of use in white schools. The buildings were mostly without air conditioning, so teachers and students opened windows and used fans to stave off the heavy Florida heat. But one distinct advantage of her situation was exposure to black culture and, especially, black literature.</p><p>The day she spoke on the radio, Filer recited “The Creation” by James Weldon Johnson; the story of Genesis spoken, rather than written.</p><p>“This Great God,” the poem reads, “Like a mammy bending over her baby / Kneeled down in the dust / Toiling over a lump of clay / Till He shaped it in His own image.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/227911064"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>After Filer’s high school graduation in 1956, she couldn’t move onto college. The University of Florida didn’t accept black students at the time, and Filer couldn’t afford to live away from home to attend a historically black college. Instead, she began working as a nursing assistant.</p><p>Filer would not be able to attend college for more than 10 years, until Santa Fe College opened as an integrated school in 1966.</p><p>Nursing evoked in her many of the same feelings that sparked her passion for poetry. Poems took work to understand and perform, but each one gave her insight into her world. As a nurse, her patients demanded her time and taxed her emotions, but in treating them, she found those same unique insights. She quickly grew to love the work.</p><p>Filer quickly found an important difference between her two passions. Nursing lacked the deep respect for African-American culture Filer cherished. She faced racism often — patients didn’t respect her and sometimes dismissed her entirely in favor of a white nurse.</p><p>And the doctors were no better, she says.</p><p>"If we were there,” she says of herself and her black co-workers, “and there was a white person in view, [a doctor] would go to the white person."</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>As the 1950s came to a close, the cultural swell of the Civil Rights Movement poured into Gainesville. Filer heard about the work happening around the country by leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr., who inspired her to make change happen in her own community.</p><p>She was not the only person in Gainesville fed up with the status quo. A group of white women, mostly wives of University of Florida professors, also pressed for change. These women, barred from teaching at the university because of their gender, founded a group called Gainesville Women for Equal Rights, or GWER.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Vivan-Filer-0009.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Vivian Filer holds a photo of her family at her college graduation.

Wearing his signature white electric guitar suspenders, Blake performs the “Tom Show” for his core of regulars during happy hour.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake prepares a drink during happy hour at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville, Fl.(Photo by Chris Watkins)"><figcaption>Tom Blake prepares a drink during happy hour at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville, Fl.(Photo by Chris Watkins)</figcaption></figure><p>Alcohol flows as Stevie Ray Vaughan blasts from the jukebox glowing in the corner. The smell of popcorn and cigarette smoke lingers in the air. Blake dances between pouring drinks and creating conversation, never missing a beat.</p><p>Before his 35-year career as the happy hour bartender at Lillian’s Music Store, and before he wrote and published his “Exile” series of novels documenting his life experiences, Blake and his rock-n-roll band “The Dead Dog” were almost famous. With Johnny Poontang as the lead singer they toured France in the late '70s.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.</p></blockquote><p>“People used to ask us, why was an American band trying to make it in France,” Blake says. “We would always explain to them, if we are going to go around the block and try to make it as a band, we thought we would pick a beautiful city, so no matter what happened we would have that experience.”</p><p>In retrospect, Blake says that this was a good decision.</p><p>Blake and Johnny formed “The Dead Dog” and they toured Europe for three years.</p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-5.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake plays his Gibson 335 guitar that he has had since he played with his rock-n-roll band, “The Dead Dog,” in France.

Blake performed his opening instrumental piece, and as if on cue, Johnny walked out onto the stage with a look on his face of I’ll explain later.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.</p></blockquote><p>“That night we played the best show of our career,” Blake says. “We were really the hottest band in Brussels that night.”</p><p>After the show, Johnny explained that he had broken up with Gava, and that he had informed her that he didn't think that the band needed her help getting gigs anymore.</p><p>This caused a rupture in the band for a while, Blake says. Without Gava’s help “The Dead Dog” struggled to book more gigs.</p><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/331370008&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake talks about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang.</figcaption></figure><p> Now 36 years after “The Dead Dog” toured Europe, Blake reminisces about the first time that he met his friend Johnny Poontang, while he was a student at the University of Virginia.</p><p>“My first encounter with Johnny Poontang was when the University of Virginia was still a very conservative university,” Blake says.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>Vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.</p></blockquote><p>Johnny and a friend were running for student government under the anarchist party ticket. Their campaign poster was a picture of Johnny and his friend holding a cartoon bomb, like the one that Yosemite Sam sported in the “Looney Toons” cartoon series. With the slogan of, “vote anarchist, we're gonna blow this place up.”</p><p>Johnny didn’t win the election, but he and Blake formed a lifelong friendship and bonded over music.</p><p>In January of 1979, after graduating from the University of Virginia and spending three years struggling to make it big in France, Blake, his girlfriend Genevieve and Johnny Poontang all piled into a car heading from Geneva, Switzerland, back to Aix-en-Provence, the band's home base in the south of France, with Johnny at the wheel.</p><p> “We were heading, we thought to the south of France,” Blake says. “But we noticed the smell of mustard in the air, which meant that we were outside the town of Dijon.”</p><p>Instead of driving south toward Aix-en-Provence, Johnny intentionally drove north to the city of Dijon.</p><p> Johnny pulled over at a truck stop on the edge of town and told Blake and Genevieve that he had to return to America to secure more funding for the band. He got out of the car and walked to the nearest truck, knocked on the window and told the driver, “tu va à Paris.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-4.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake with his wife, Genevieve, enjoying an afternoon with friends at One Love Café in Gainesville.

After several months and no sign of Johnny, it became apparent that he was not coming back.</p><p> So, the two packed their bags and moved to Virginia. There Blake put together another band with a local guitar player named Ziggy. “At that point, we played around Charlottesville for about a year, and Genevieve said it’s time to try to make it again,” Blake says.</p><p>The three of them packed their bags and headed to Jamaica. There they lived in the guest quarters at Genevieve’s father’s estate in Montego Bay. To make ends meet they worked at a small deli named Little John’s Deli, where Blake and Genevieve made sandwiches and Ziggy worked nights washing dishes. Soon Ziggy got cold feet, left the band and returned to his studies at the University of Virginia.</p><p>Shortly after Ziggy’s departure, they discovered that Genevieve was pregnant with the first of their three children, son Gabriel.</p><p>Blake and Genevieve quickly moved to the closest college town, Gainesville, Florida.</p><p>“I’ve always lived in college towns and the greatest thing about college towns is the intergenerational mixture and the greatest level of tolerance that can exist in college towns,” Blake says.</p><p>The two coasted into town on fumes, broke and nearly homeless.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-6.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake and his wife Genevieve on their wedding day outside of the Alachua County Courthouse.

Every time that he steps behind the bar, it is a performance, and to Blake that is what makes bartending a great job.</p><p>Blake has been performing what he calls “The Tom Show” at Lillian’s happy hour since 1983. He serves drinks and creates conversation among regulars, many of whom say that they come to Lillian’s because of Blake.</p><p>Blake is what has kept Wade Hurt coming back for nearly 35 years.</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226193215"></iframe><figcaption>Tom Blake, the happy hour bartender from Lillian's Music Store talks about his 35-year carrier as a bartender.</figcaption></figure><p>Chances are that if you are a regular to Lillian’s happy hour, Blake will greet you by your nickname when you walk through the door.</p><p>Blake says that since “The Tom Show” is based on the people who came into the bar and the character that they possess, the nicknames came naturally.</p><p>“The nicknames are terms of endearment that capture part of who you are in an ironic way, or a humorous way,” Blake said.</p><p>Take “Dr. Dirt” for example. Wayde Hurt, or “Dr. Dirt,” as Blake refers to him, is a retired soil scientist and UF professor from Mississippi. “But, when you are a soil scientist from Mississippi, ‘I am just a professor of dirt’,” Blake says.</p><p>Blake attributes his success at bartending to being able to drawing conversation out of anyone who sits down at the bar.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/TomBlakePhotoStoryChrisWatkins-8-1.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Tom Blake speaks with customers from behind the bar at Lillian’s Music Store in downtown Gainesville.

Connie Canney, another Gainesville activist, went to the police to try and bail her out.</p><p>	“I went into the police station to try and bail her out, and I saw they had (Thomas’) house circled in red on a map,” she says. “You would think she was some hardened criminal.”</p><p>	Thomas’ three children stayed with her friends while she was in jail.</p><hr class="doubleLine"><figure class=""><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/330969998&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption>Carol Thomas reflects on the time she spent in the Alachua County Jail.</figcaption></figure><p>	During her time in jail, Thomas and the other inmates became close. One day, she said the guards brought in a woman who was pregnant.</p><p>	Thomas believed the new inmate was having a miscarriage when the guards left her in a cell.</p><p>	She and the other inmates filled the toilets in their cells with anything they could get their hands on and flushed. They kept flushing until the water was spilling out, flooding the floor of their cells.</p><p>	The guards came and took the woman to the hospital.</p><p>	“If someone’s life was in danger, and they wouldn’t listen to us, we had to do something,” Thomas says. “There would be people they would bring into the jail that they found on the side of the road. This is not the place they should’ve brought them.”</p><hr class="doubleLine"><p>	When Thomas was released in 1967, she says she had been told the state wanted to take her children away. She was afraid the state would “keep picking on her."</p><p>	Thomas divorced her husband in 1967 and moved to Louisville, Kentucky. She took a job working as an organizer with the Southern Conference Education Fund, a community action organization.</p><p>	While working there, Thomas was visited by a couple who said their landlord was trying to evict them because of a gas leak in the house. They said they called an inspector when they smelled gas and he had reported it to the landlord.</p><p>	“The way it worked was that the tenants had all the responsibility and the landlords had all the money,” Thomas says.</p><p>	She looked into the state of public housing in Louisville.</p><p>	“There would be houses that didn’t have any front doors,” Thomas says. “In fact, one child in one home was electrocuted. She was playing over by the television, which had exposed wiring on the back, and because the roof leaked the water had pooled near it. She touched it and was electrocuted.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Photo-of-Carol-with-a-homemade-picket-sign-5.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Carol Thomas holds a picket sign she used when demonstrating on Gainesville sidewalks.
