Throughout elementary school, college and even now, the Miles' home came to be a place where friends were welcomed with open arms, but they learned quickly that time spent with Phoebe Miles was unpredictable.</p><p>When Elena Miles was in high school, she remembers her mom calling her outside to race toy sailboats powered by lighting cashews on fire.</p><p>And when her mother came to visit her at Wheaton College, she persuaded her daughter's college friends to participate in a dance illustrating what the sodium pump does to your kidneys.</p><p>“All of a sudden I was dancing around pretending to be sugar entering into a sodium pump while my friend was sodium potassium,” she said. “It was ridiculous, but it was very fun.”</p><p>All of it is quintessential Phoebe Miles.</p><p>“I think it’s in her blood,” Elena Miles said. “The Cade Thing.”</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_0578.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles sits in the patio of her parents' Gainesville home.

Cade was the leader of the team that invented Gatorade in 1965, the sports drink turned sideline staple and global phenomenon.</p><p>The museum opens to the public in the spring of 2018, but for 12 years, Phoebe Miles has pushed it along from concept to construct. She feels it’s her job – her calling – to tell the story of Gainesville.</p><blockquote class="center"><p>One of my motivating factors and the reason I feel I’m called to do this is I thought it was so spectacular to grow up with a father as an inventor,” she said. “I was exposed to so many things. Every day was kind of exciting.
    </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p>Cade was a gardener, tending to roses and citrus trees in the backyard, and a musician, playing the violin, while his daughter accompanied him on the piano.</p><p>Cade would shut down parties to recite poems from memory, embarrassing his daughter. As an adult, those memories astound her.&nbsp;<br></p><p>“And he must have had them grouped in his mind according to type of event,” she said. “He had funny poems. He had serious poems. He could quote ‘The Raven’ from memory. And sometimes you would have to listen to that.”</p><figure class=" video"><iframe src="" frameborder="0" allowfull="" data-aspectratio="0.5625" width="640" height="360" class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/226794764"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At times, he would load his family into one of his antique Studebakers and drive to a Dipper Dan ice cream shop, where each child was allowed a double dip of ice cream.<br></p><p>He liked to get lost, finding his way back home along country roads.&nbsp;</p><p>"He was a romantic," she said. "So if you were out in the middle of a field in a Studebaker and a lightning storm came, it was just the best. Especially if you got lost."</p><p>Phoebe Miles said Cade was a lifelong Lutheran and often spoke of the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was kind of his guiding philosophy, she said:</p><blockquote class="center"><p>If I can help and I have the means to help, that’s what I need to do.
    </p></blockquote><hr class="doubleLine"><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Phoebe Miles, then Phoebe Cade, met her husband while the two were attending Buchholz High School. At the beginning of his senior year, his parents sold their Gainesville house and planned to move to Nebraska. They wanted him to join them.</pdir="ltr"></p><figure class="img left"><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/IMG_6573.jpg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe and Richard Miles at Grad Night at Walt Disney World in 1981.

His parents told him if he could find not only a family to live with, but also parents who would act as his legal guardians for his last year, he could finish out high school in Gainesville.</p><p>That’s where the Cade family came in.</p><p>“During the course of that year is when we fell in love,” Phoebe Miles said.<br></p><p>Richard Miles, a retired foreign service officer, said his wife is enthusiastic about making things happen.</p><p>“Well, she’s very energetic,” he said. “She cares deeply about ideas.”</p><p>In high school, he said, she was voted “Most Likely To Spontaneously Combust,” a joke award of sorts, but also a tribute to the never-ending questions she had that could make teachers crazy.<br></p><p>“Even in high school, you know, if it was just a bunch of high-school kids sitting around, Phoebe would usually be the one that would come up with the idea of what we were going to do that day or what place we should go and so on,” he said. “So her house, when we were growing up in high school, was that house that everyone kind of congregates around, because we knew something would be going on at the Cade’s house.”</p><p>Elena Miles, the youngest of Phoebe and Richard Miles’ three children, said her own childhood home was “the hangout house," where her mother was quick to invite friends into one of her experiments or projects.</p><p>"She’s just so inclusive of everybody and so eager to learn about everybody," she said.<br></p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/08/Phoebe-Miles.jpeg" data-sizes="auto" alt="Phoebe Miles shows off a speaker that children will make in classes at the Cade Museum with an electromagnetic coil.

It’s a reminder that the spring opening is near, but not yet in sight; her shell-shaped building is still just a shell.<br></p><p>She lingers the longest in the Gatorade Gallery. That exhibit will tell the story of how the current innovation economy in Gainesville, and to some extent across the nation, traces back to the invention of Gatorade.<br></p><figure class="right"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/335633702&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>"It became a world famous product but was heavily contested of who owned the intellectual property because in those days there wasn’t a clear law outlining how a university professor using federally funded research could patent a product," she said. "It wasn’t really allowed. So it became a landmark case nationwide."</p><p>The drink itself was also a game changer, transforming dehydration therapies worldwide for developing countries, cholera victims and even astronauts, she said.</p><p>As she makes her way through the museum, she mentions repeatedly how her main goal is to inspire.<br></p><p>From the kid’s version of a “Shark Tank” room, where they can practice their pitches, to a wall panel on President Washington calling the government "a great experiment," Phoebe Miles wants to introduce children to innovation in all its forms.<br></p><p>She said she wants children to be just as excited as she was years ago, watching her father in his laboratory.<br></p><p>“I think the Cade Museum is meant to encourage each visitor to be the best that they can be, to think more like an inventor,” she said.</p><figure class="img "><img src="" class="lazyload" data-src="https://www.wuft.org/news/files/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-10.12.44-PM.png" data-sizes="auto" alt="Inside the future Gatorade Gallery, Richard Miles shows Phoebe Miles and high-school friend Jim Sowell a video about Gatorade.

Phoebe Miles unlocks the fence in front of what will soon be the parking lot.</p><p> 	</p><p> 	</p><p>From Google Earth, Phoebe Miles says the whole area should look like a giant nautilus shell. The building itself was inspired partly by the Pantheon and follows the Fibonacci spiral, an application of the divine proportion. Phoebe Miles likes to call it the “creativity spiral.”</p><p>As they walk inside, Richard Miles gestures to the center of the concrete floor, below the circular skylight, where the spiral will begin to circle, slowly curving its way into the park and walking trail outside.</p><p> 	</p><p>“Out to the world,” Phoebe Miles says, finishing her husband’s thought. “Gainesville to the world.”</p><p><pdir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It’s a small city, but Phoebe Miles has never felt restrained by its city limits.
