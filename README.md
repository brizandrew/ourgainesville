# Our Gainesville
During the summer of 2017, WUFT reporters focused their reporting on a community-engagement project that celebrates and highlights the rich diversity of Gainesville. The project, _Our Gainesville_, is comprised of individual stories of the people living, working, praying, performing and more. It dives into our past and present. It tells the stories of who we are, where we are and what we are. It shows What Makes Gainesville, Gainesville!
